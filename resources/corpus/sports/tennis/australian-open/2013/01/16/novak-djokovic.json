DJOKOVIC/R. Harrison\r\n  6‑1, 6‑2, 6‑3\r\n\r\nTHE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. \r\n\r\nQ.  Is that one of the best Grand Slam matches you've played? \r\nNOVAK DJOKOVIC:  In the earlier rounds, yes, probably.  I mean, I played many matches in Grand Slams in my career, so it's tough to compare which one is the best I would take under the circumstances. \r\nAnd also it depends at what stage of the tournament and the quality of the player.  I mean, I definitely didn't want to underestimate my opponent tonight, even though he's younger than me, still didn't establish himself, you know, as a top 20 or top 30 player. \r\nBut I still knew that he has a quality.  Mentally he's probably going to go out on the court knowing he doesn't have anything to lose.  He's going to try to smack serves and forehands.  I went with that kind of mindset on the court, you know, just trying to play as sharp as possible from the start, and I've done so. \r\n\r\nQ.  Did you want to send some sort of statement who is a young sort of rising star of the tennis world, as well?\r\nNOVAK DJOKOVIC:  Well, we all know that the hard work and dedication pays off in the end.  So I'm sure, knowing him for last two years, that he's gonna put on these hours on the court and off the court being very professional, committed. \r\nSo that's why I think they rate him as one of the up‑and‑coming rising stars from the United States.  They put a lot of hopes into him. \r\nBut it's a process.  And tennis has changed.  It's much more demanding nowadays with I guess the competition that is around the tour and many quality players. \r\nIt's more difficult to make that breakthrough for a youngster.  He needs patience and he needs to believe in himself and wait for a chance.\r\n\r\nQ.  With your performance tonight were you trying to send a message to him?\r\nNOVAK DJOKOVIC:  I believe this is the right message, not the other way around. \r\n\r\nQ.  He's talked openly about wanting to win Grand Slams and be No.1.  He's been around the tour for a few years and hasn't yet made the third round of a Grand Slam.  Do you think those sort of high heights are in the future?  You've played him a few times now. \r\nNOVAK DJOKOVIC:  Remember, when I was his age, you have to in a way have confidence in yourself and try to set up a high goal, because that's something that inspires you always to practice, to work hard. \r\nI don't see anything wrong in having high ambitions and goals.  Why not?  I'm sure that a super majority of the players here in this Grand Slam or in the top 100, if not everybody, wants to be best in what they do.  Somebody admits it, somebody doesn't. \r\nIn the end of the day, of course on the other hand you have to have respect for the sport and for your opponents, and just take it step by step, I guess. \r\nHe knows the best what he really wants inside of him.  It's a matter of, as I said, self‑belief, putting a lot of hours and a lot of matches on the tour. \r\n\r\nQ.  Just playing the way you played tonight, is that important?  Does that help you for the later stages of the tournament? \r\nNOVAK DJOKOVIC:  Well, for sure.  I mean, you're trying to perform your best in every match that you play on. \r\nThis was definitely a better performance than the first round.  You know, I managed to play in a very high level already in the second round of a Grand Slam, which is very encouraging for next challenge. \r\n\r\nFastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            \n          ","interview":[{"question":"Is that one of the best Grand Slam matches you've played?","answer":"In the earlier rounds, yes, probably.
