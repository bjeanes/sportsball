WOZNIACKI/D. Vekic\r\n  6‑1, 6‑4\r\n\r\nTHE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. \r\n\r\nQ.  She played a little bit like a very talented but crazy junior.  You had to stay in there with her. \r\nCAROLINE WOZNIACKI:  You know, I know the feeling, how it is sometimes going in and playing someone when you're young, you're playing a top player.  I definitely saw a lot of potential in her. \r\nI thought actually she was going to go for more, but I could tell that she can keep the ball in play and go for it when she needs to. \r\nObviously she's a very tall girl.  She's young.  She's going to improve a lot over the next few years still.  I definitely believe that we're going to see a lot of her in the future.\r\n\r\nQ.  Did you expect her to miss as much as she did or did you feel like you had to force the play and control it a little bit more?\r\nCAROLINE WOZNIACKI:  Both.  I knew that I had to put the pressure on her from the beginning.  I knew I have to make her move, I have to put the pressure on her, I didn't have to go for wild shots. \r\nI knew that she would feel the pressure sooner or later. \r\n\r\nQ.  Did she make you feel old, knowing she's the same age as when you played first?\r\nCAROLINE WOZNIACKI:  I mean, she's six years younger than me.  That's crazy.  That definitely makes me feel old (smiling). \r\nBut I guess we're going to see more of that in the future.  I should just get used to that. \r\n\r\nQ.  You've talked about the fun.  Obviously the sport is more fun when you're winning.  Was it fun today?\r\nCAROLINE WOZNIACKI:  Yeah, it's fun.  But, you know, it was hot out there today.  You could really feel it burning. \r\nWhen I went out for my warmup this morning, I was like, Oh, it's not too bad.  You know, it's 39, but I didn't really feel it.  It's cloudy.  It's okay. \r\nBut I knew once I was going to go out on court the sun is going to break through and it's going to be crazy hot. \r\nOf course, that happened.  It's maybe less pleasurable when you're out in that heat.  You're winning.  It just gives‑‑ you know, it's why you work hard in the off‑season, why you have to be in good shape, because you have to be prepared for everything.\r\n\r\nQ.  How pleased were you with the consistency of your ball striking today?  It looked pretty impressive. \r\nCAROLINE WOZNIACKI:  Yeah, I thought I played really well in most parts of the match.  I had a couple of games there at 4‑1 where I maybe lost a little bit of concentration.  You know, she came back, did a few good serves.  All of a sudden it's 4‑3 and you really need to step it up again. \r\nBut, yeah, in general I was happy with my game and the way I was playing.\r\n\r\nQ.  You hit some big serves at times.  It's an important part of your game.  You've been working on it for a few years.  If you get in tight matches, you need to come up with that. \r\nCAROLINE WOZNIACKI:  It's important to know you can rely on your serve.  Also, you know, get a lot of deep returns.  It's important. \r\nI mean, she was serving pretty well out there.  I've been playing, especially the first match, a really big server.  She came out with 194, 191s, I could still push it back deep in the court.  I think that gives you some confidence also when you're playing a girl like this today, that I know I can rely on my returns.\r\n\r\nQ.  Is it a little frustrating that last year you were asked about the pressure to back up being No.1 by winning a major, now you're asked about the pressure to get back to No.1. \r\nCAROLINE WOZNIACKI:  No.  It's part of the game.  It's part of the whole thing.  It's fine.  I just do my thing and that's basically it. \r\n\r\nQ.  The golf colleague out there. \r\nCAROLINE WOZNIACKI:  My golf? \r\n\r\nQ.  Someone else's golf who might be playing well at the moment. \r\nCAROLINE WOZNIACKI:  Yeah, somebody's out there right now, trying to battle it out.  I was just having some stretching and some treatment.  I was just following on live scores.  Maybe I can find a TV screen somewhere that shows it.\r\n\r\nQ.  You said on the court you were at the physio's and you were by far the oldest person in there. \r\nCAROLINE WOZNIACKI:  Yes.\r\n\r\nQ.  Are you the oldest youngest player on tour now?\r\nCAROLINE WOZNIACKI:  There are still a few older ones than me (laughter). \r\nBut, yeah, that happened.  That was not great for my confidence.  I still want to try to feel young out here.  But, you know, it's the way of life, I guess.  22, it's old in the tennis world soon. \r\n\r\nQ.  Do you actually feel a generational difference at 22 to a 16 or 17‑year‑old?\r\nCAROLINE WOZNIACKI:  Yeah, I feel a difference.  I can see some young ones coming up.  I thought she didn't look like a 16‑year‑old just because she's so tall.  You can see she can develop physically and still be stronger at things. \r\nYeah, I guess I felt older when I was 16 than, you know, looking at 16‑year‑olds nowadays.  But I guess you always feel a bit different when you're in it.\r\n\r\nQ.  They're playing a lot of music.  You have no idea?  You feel like an old person, that I don't know that? \r\nCAROLINE WOZNIACKI:  No, not quite that old.  Not quite there yet (smiling). \r\n\r\nFastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            \n          ","interview":[{"question":"She played a little bit like a very talented but crazy junior.
