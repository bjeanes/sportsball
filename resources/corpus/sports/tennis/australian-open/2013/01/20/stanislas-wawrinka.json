Wawrinka\r\n      1‑6, 7‑5, 6‑4, 6‑7, 12‑10\r\n    \r\n    THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. \r\n    \r\n    Q.  Was that perhaps the best match you ever played and coming off feeling the worst you've ever felt?\r\n    STANISLAS WAWRINKA:  For sure.  Yeah, for sure.  But I think it's by far my best match I ever play, especially in five sets against the No.1 player. \r\n    Especially I was dealing with myself all the five hours, trying to always find solution, trying to always fight against me and against him to stay with him. \r\n    At the end I was really, really close.  For sure I'm really sad.  It's a big deception to lose that match.  But I think there is more positive than negative. \r\n    \r\n    Q.  Has anyone suggested you were a little unlucky with a call at a crucial stage of the match and you were a bit too kind to yourself and should have challenged?\r\n    STANISLAS WAWRINKA:  I did one challenge important in the tiebreak, first point. \r\n    But, no, I cannot say I was unlucky for that.  When you play five hours, for sure you have some option to win.  You need to fight to stay with him.  I don't think it's not one bad call or one challenge that can change the match. \r\n    At the end he was still there.  He was playing great tennis.  We were both tired.  But I really fight like a dog, like always. \r\n    \r\n    Q.  You came out playing such aggressive, positive tennis.  Was there a moment serving for the second set where you started to think a bit about where you were and what was happening?\r\n    STANISLAS WAWRINKA:  Yeah, for sure I was thinking a little bit more.  Maybe I was hoping that he start to make mistake and give me the game. \r\n    But I don't think that even if I was up two sets to love, I don't think the results will change because everybody knows how he's fighting every match. \r\n    Yeah, I don't think was the key of the match neither.  I had some opportunity in the few set to break him.  At 4‑4 I had some chance to take the match.  But he was just better. \r\n    \r\n    Q.  Do you think there's much you could have done different in that match?\r\n    STANISLAS WAWRINKA:  No, I don't think so.  You know, after five hours of tennis, especially good tennis, I need few days to see exactly if I need to change something or if I come back to the match I will change something. \r\n    Right now, I don't think so.  For sure I was serving for the second set to be up two sets to love.  But, as I said, in five sets, five hours, you always have some opportunity to win a set or to win the match. \r\n    If you don't take it, he's going to take it.\r\n    \r\n    Q.  What was the feeling like when you had him so much on the defensive and he was obviously so surprised by your aggression?\r\n    STANISLAS WAWRINKA:  I was just trying to stay focused on my game and to keep playing my best game, my best level, try to push him.  I knew he would always try to change something.  He would always try to serve better, to put more pressure. \r\n    But, yeah, I was just trying to be focused on myself. \r\n    \r\n    Q.  How did you stay positive even after you let the second set slip away?\r\n    STANISLAS WAWRINKA:  Because I was playing great tennis.  Even if I lost the second set with some great opportunity, I was playing some great tennis against the No.1 in front of a full house.  I don't know why I would be negative.  I was just trying to stay positive for the match, you know. \r\n    In five set, I always know that I can come back, I can play better, I can finish well, I can stay five hours on the court, at least try.  That's why I was still pushing myself to try to play better. \r\n    \r\n    Q.  Did you feel okay physically in the fifth set?\r\n    STANISLAS WAWRINKA:  No, I was feeling tired, too.  I was starting.  But not only in the fifth set, already in the third and fourth set, you know, I was starting to cramp a little bit. \r\n    I know how it is in five sets.  You have more than one life.  Sometimes you feel completely dead after one set and you know you can come back.  You need to relax a little bit and try to push yourself to be there. \r\n    If we see the fifth set, for sure we look tired both, but we are still fighting with what we can. \r\n    \r\n    Q.  Do you think you can use the way you played and the calmness you showed as a means of improving more in the future? \r\n    STANISLAS WAWRINKA:  No, I think I can use.  I hope I will use it.  I think it's important if I want to keep improve myself, my game, to try to come back closer to the top 10.  I need to use all the tournament that I did this week. \r\n    \r\n    FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n                \n          ","interview":[{"question":"Was that perhaps the best match you ever played and coming off feeling the worst you've ever felt?","answer":"For sure.
