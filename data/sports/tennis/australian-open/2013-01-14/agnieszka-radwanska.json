Was it a bit of a surprise in the first set, do you think?","answer":"Well, I think the worst on this match was the wind. I think we both couldn't win one game from the one side. I think I was just losing against the wind, pretty much.I think I just didn't start aggressive enough, and I'm just happy that I could come back in the first set and play already much better in the second set.","person":"AGNIESZKA RADWANSKA"},{"question":"The last two tournament wins have obviously been great. What sort of confidence does that give you coming into this tournament?","answer":"Well, for sure it's been a great two weeks for me.
