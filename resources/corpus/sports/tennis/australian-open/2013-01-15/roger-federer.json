{"sport":"Tennis","event":"AUSTRALIAN OPEN ","date":"2013-01-15","people":["Roger Federer"],"interview":[{"question":"Were you happy with that performance? Did you always feel in control out there?","answer":"Yeah, I mean, obviously I started with the early break, and then saved a few break points, and then had the lead ever since. So obviously when you're in the lead, you feel better, you feel less pressure, you try a few things to see if those works and then you have options up your sleeve. I'm obviously very happy with this first‑round match, so total control. He can be a tricky opponent, you know, but I guess his playing style doesn't disturb me that much overall.I'm happy I was able to play a clean match out there today.","person":"ROGER FEDERER"},{"question":"They're forecasting 90 degrees for your next match. How is the heat going to effect yourself?","answer":"We will see if we play day or night, number one. Obviously has a big effect, but I'm not worried about the heat in any way.I have practiced and played so many matches over the years in a lot of heat. I almost favor myself over my opponent in the heat. Obviously when you get the hot match, you try not to stay out there for too long. But then again, you know, if you have to, that's what it is, you know. That's part of the game. It can be maybe an advantage for me or for my opponent, so we'll see how it goes and we'll get to see with the scheduling.","person":"ROGER FEDERER"},{"question":"He said he couldn't read your game at all. Do you know you have that effect on your opponent and are you aware of it in a match that guys maybe don't anticipate at all?","answer":"Well, I mean, I guess the advantage for us as top players is that we do play against top players more often than they do, so we're used to maybe bigger serves all around, better movement, you know, more unpredictable stuff, which they don't get the opportunity obviously to play against, you know.So that's I think an advantage for us, but that's why I think it's very important, the work ethic and bringing it day in and day out to give yourself that opportunity. Every match you play against a top guy is usually going to bring you a step further because you realize what else you have to improve. You know, this guy has apparently got the biggest forehand or backhand out there, all the rest you face is going to be a little bit easier, you know. So I didn't know I had that effect out there today, but, you know, I do have some options in my game and I used them well. You know, I kept coming in at him as well to shorten the rallies and make him feel the pressure. I guess that was the good play today against him.","person":"ROGER FEDERER"},{"question":"You're facing Sela or Davydenko in the next round. What are your thoughts about him?","answer":"No, I haven't thought about it much. I think they're on;y going on court now. I don't know if he was necessarily a qualifier or in the main draw straightaway ‑ I don't even know.But I played Sela maybe once or twice before, so I know him a little bit. Obviously Nikolay, I know him, you know, a whole lot more. He's my age. He played, I don't know, maybe 15 times. I played him at a time when he wasn't also in his best streak and in his best years, really, and he was in the top 4 or top 5 for a long time. I played him in the semis of the Grand Slams and at the World Tour Finals when he beat me. Then he got me again in Doha, and I played him here the following week where it was a very difficult draw for me to have and I found a way. You always have to expect that out of Davydenko to face if I were to play him, and not the one who's not been playing so well. It was two years ago I think he really struggled with his serve, but seems like he's coming back around. I had a very close match with him in Rotterdam last year. Should have won in two; ended up being 4‑All, Love‑40 in the third. I was very close of losing. Next thing you know, nobody talks about it. I went on to win the tournament and nobody talks about Nikolay. So it's nice to see him playing well again. And if I do play well against him, you're aware that he is a top player who can do a lot of damage. I better be well prepared and play well.","person":"ROGER FEDERER"},{"question":"Will you be watching Bernard Tomic's match tonight?","answer":"Is he playing first? Second? I don't know. I haven't got my plan yet for tonight, dinner plans. I saw a bit of Lleyton yesterday. I decided at the end I'd rather go out with my friends and have dinner and hopefully come back for the fifth set in case, and that never happened, unfortunately. (Laughter.)Today maybe. I mean, I don't know. I will plan around the beginning of the match maybe. We'll see.","person":"ROGER FEDERER"},{"question":"Is this the longest break you have had between official matches that you can recall? Did that make you more eager to get out there?","answer":"I don't know. Could be. Yeah, this could be a long break. What has it been, almost two months maybe? Yeah, I mean, I have been close in the past. I think after Wimbledon I played Gstaad one year and didn't play until after the US Open, or other years also.You know, it obviously depends if you do count exhibitions or not. For some reason you guys don't count the South American exhibitions, but you do count Kooyong. So, okay. That's a good way to look at it. (Laughter.)I think back from my last match in Colombia, so all of a sudden it's not that long of a break anymore.","person":"ROGER FEDERER"},{"question":"In cycling, with Lance winning on the tour, do you have any thoughts on I guess reports that he's admitted that he doped to Oprah?","answer":"I'm sorry. I didn't understand a word you said. I'm trying to understand.","person":"ROGER FEDERER"},{"question":"Lance Armstrong has apparently admitted to Oprah that he has doped. I'm wondering if you watched any cycling or if you have any thoughts?","answer":"Well, apparently yes or no. Big deal, you know, actually. But I mean, no, I never really followed it that closely, to be honest. I'd be intrigued just to hear the interview. There has been a lot of talk about it, and obviously, you know, a lot of focus on Lance and the cycling part.It's obviously been a difficult situation for the whole of the sport and for him and all the people involved. So I've got to get the facts right and just hear what he said, really.","person":"ROGER FEDERER"},{"question":"I know you have put out a statement. Would you like to say something about Brad Drewett?","answer":"Well, obviously very sad, you know, situation for all of us. I saw him yesterday and he told me the news. Obviously very emotional, you know. I know Brad ever since I came on tour and I started to play a bit better, I guess, you know. Obviously it was very important to bring the Masters Cup to Shanghai, and he was the tournament director then over there and also London. So he was so influential; he was obviously a player. He goes so far back and has touched so many people, you know, throughout his career as a player and then also as an executive and then CEO. So it's been very hard to see him not doing so well, so we wish him the best, of course. Can only thank him for everything he's done already and more. I'm sure he's going to stay on for a bit more and do more work, so we thank him for that. Obviously it's tough. I worked with him very closely, especially the last few years now, and he deserved to be, you know, CEO and chairman.So it's been difficult, you know. I knew him very well and I call him a friend. That's not nice to see, but it's unfortunate, you know.","person":"ROGER FEDERER"},{"question":"You have been in Argentina lately. What do you think about the experience that you have there?","answer":"Obviously a crazy, good experience, really. We had 20,000 people on the one night, and then 20 the next and same stadium in Tigre. It was an incredible atmosphere. One of those moments that, you know, I had the chills and the goosebumps walking in and out of the stadium.I felt like more than just a tennis player those nights, and I cannot thank the people enough that sort of gave me such a warm reception. Juan Martin was a great host as such, really. I had a great, great time, I must admit.You know, can never repeat that first moment you come into a new country, you know. Like I came to Argentina and I didn't know what to expect. I also wanted it to be that way, and it was so much better than I expected. I can say the same about Brazil and also Colombia. It was a once‑in‑a‑lifetime opportunity for me to play over there. And that it was as incredible as it was, was a fantastic experience for me. I loved every moment of it.","person":"ROGER FEDERER"}]}
