I don't think so. I was talking with him and he said the problem start at 4‑1 of the first set and after that he couldn't move really well and he decide to retired.","person":"NICOLAS ALMAGRO"},{"question":"And did that play on your mind at all or were you just focused on what you needed to do?","answer":"Well, I was trying to be focused on my match, on my tennis. Well, I think I play a really good first set. After that, the mind start to work a little bit because you know something happen but you don't know really good what happen. But I think I was very focus all the match. With 5‑1 in the second set, was really tough for him. I think he decide to stop because the injury would be worse.","person":"NICOLAS ALMAGRO"},{"question":"Looking forward to your next match against Ferrer. You've met 12 times. You haven't been able to get past him. What are your thoughts on that matchup?","answer":"Well, will be a good fight. We know him. I know him. He know me. Will be somewhat different match. We never play in a Grand Slam, I think, if I remember well. And, well, is a big opportunity for me to be in a semifinal. I'm ready to fight. I'm healthy and I'm happy with my tennis. I think I'm playing really good. He hitting the ball with a lot of confidence, and we'll see what happen on Tuesday.","person":"NICOLAS ALMAGRO"},{"question":"Is there anything to change in your game maybe?","answer":"I don't know why. I'm playing good. I'm hitting the ball with confidence, playing really aggressive, going to the net to close the point, and, well, that's it. I need to be ready for a big fight. I'm going to prepare that match tomorrow, not today.","person":"NICOLAS ALMAGRO"},{"question":"It's unfortunate what happened to Tipsarevic. Going into the second round, having such a short game, will that help you in the quarterfinals?","answer":"I don't think so. I not completely happy because Janko was injury. That's not the way you want to win. But, well, that's the sport. Sometimes you couldn't do your best and you need to decide to stop if you want to be ready for the next tournament. Well, I think he took the best decision if he's really bad. And, well, I'm happy because I think I won a tough match in two set. But, well, I say to you again, is not completely happiness because something happen.","person":"NICOLAS ALMAGRO"}]}
