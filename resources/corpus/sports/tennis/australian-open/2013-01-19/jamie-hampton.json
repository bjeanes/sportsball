{"sport":"Tennis","event":"AUSTRALIAN OPEN ","date":"2013-01-19","people":["Jamie Hampton"],"interview":[{"question":"You obviously were in a lot of discomfort out there.","answer":"Yeah.","person":"JAMIE HAMPTON"},{"question":"Can you tell us about it? How were you beforehand? At what point it happened? How bad was it after?","answer":"Going into the match I was fine. About 4‑2, 4‑3, my back started hurting. I had back problems. Hurt my back last year at the French Open pretty badly. It's something I deal with day‑to‑day, and, yeah, it was hurting. Normally when my back starts hurting I start cramping.","person":"JAMIE HAMPTON"},{"question":"Is it a muscle spasm kind of thing?","answer":"I probably shouldn't be telling you this, but I have two herniated disks in my lower back.","person":"JAMIE HAMPTON"},{"question":"They act up?","answer":"Yeah.","person":"JAMIE HAMPTON"},{"question":"You get the treatment. How much better can it be made in the short term?","answer":"It's tough. I mean, I play with those shorts, which don't look great, by the way, and then I have my back taped up pretty good before every match.","person":"JAMIE HAMPTON"},{"question":"Do you get sciatica with that? Do you get shooting pain down your leg at all with the herniations?","answer":"Sometimes when it gets bad, but that's from ‑‑ normally I just cramp if I'm playing.","person":"JAMIE HAMPTON"},{"question":"Was it worse for any particular shots? Your forehand seemed to suffer.","answer":"My serve, and then just moving in general.","person":"JAMIE HAMPTON"},{"question":"Did you surprise yourself how well you played out there on Rod Laver against the world No. 1?","answer":"No. I think that I was really lucky, you know, to get the opportunity to try again considering last year I got thumped pretty good.You know, I put in a lot of hard work during the off‑season, so I was not surprised.","person":"JAMIE HAMPTON"},{"question":"What's the level of pain on a scale of 1 to 10?","answer":"Right now it's kind of gone down to a 3 or 4. On the court serving it's pretty good, 7.","person":"JAMIE HAMPTON"},{"question":"It peaks as you hit the ball?","answer":"Yeah.","person":"JAMIE HAMPTON"},{"question":"So how difficult is that to take a full swing and to really let rip knowing it's really going to hurt?","answer":"I just try to manage it on the court and slow down, take my time. When I got low it was really hurting, and there's not really much you can do. I try my best, but...","person":"JAMIE HAMPTON"},{"question":"What's your plan for how to treat this injury over time? Something you have to take time off for or get something done, fixed?","answer":"I'm sure in a few days it will be a lot better. Take some medication, see the doctor and physios, get as much treatment as I can, go home and see my physio, make my core and back as strong as possible.","person":"JAMIE HAMPTON"},{"question":"You're not going to miss any tournaments or anything trying to get better?","answer":"Probably not.","person":"JAMIE HAMPTON"},{"question":"This happened at the French Open last year? Is this when the herniation occurred?","answer":"I don't think that's when it occurred, but it got really bad there. I couldn't walk there and had to retire in my match.I went to the doctor, and that's the first time ‑‑because I have always had some back problems, but I didn't really know what it was until then. I went to the doctor and had an MRI, they're like, Well, your back is messed up.","person":"JAMIE HAMPTON"},{"question":"What were you thinking today when you started to feel it? Were you thinking, Oh, God, not again?","answer":"Yeah, a little bit. But I was more focused on the cramping part of it because I have gone into a full‑body cramp before. It's very painful. I was trying to manage that.","person":"JAMIE HAMPTON"},{"question":"Did you have to change your approach and try and shorten the points?","answer":"Yeah. Yeah.","person":"JAMIE HAMPTON"},{"question":"Recently you have played Radwanska. What can you tell us about her game?","answer":"Agnieszka? She's a really good tennis player. I think she's a lot of fun to watch. She plays good tennis. She understands you don't have to obviously smack a thousand winners to win a match.You know, you can let somebody beat themself.","person":"JAMIE HAMPTON"},{"question":"Azarenka on court said you were ripping winners and she was obviously impressed with your game. I mean, physical discomfort aside, did you come out of this match feeling you can go toe to toe with anyone?","answer":"Well, I'm pretty disappointed right now. If you ask me again later I'd probably say yes. (Smiling.)Yeah. I think, like I said, I put in a lot of hard work and it's showing.","person":"JAMIE HAMPTON"},{"question":"Haven't been much in the way of upsets in the tournament. Going in against the world No. 1, how did you rate your chances?","answer":"I was pretty confident. I thought they were pretty good, to be honest. I didn't go into the match thinking that I was going to lose. I went in with a lot of belief. And even though in the first set she won it 6‑4 and was up at one point I think 5‑1, we had some good exchanges. There was just a point here or there that was costing me the games, so...","person":"JAMIE HAMPTON"},{"question":"You have clearly been hampered in your view?","answer":"Yeah, definitely.","person":"JAMIE HAMPTON"},{"question":"What are the options here? What can be done? Because that's not a small injury, the herniation. Is there some sort of a surgical procedure or something that can be done? What are your options?","answer":"I don't know. We are trying to figure it out, physios, doctors. Yeah.","person":"JAMIE HAMPTON"},{"question":"Do you feel like the injury comes up more in big matches? This sort of tension in that situation, does that hurt your back?","answer":"Yeah, I think so. I think that when there is stress, stressful environment, you know, you're probably reaching for a little bit more and trying to hit it harder, trying to move in a little bit quicker, and, you know, the stress causes some problems.","person":"JAMIE HAMPTON"},{"question":"When you left the court, what did they do? What was the treatment?","answer":"Peeing in a cup, doping. (Smiling.)Haven't had treatment yet.","person":"JAMIE HAMPTON"},{"question":"In the middle of the match?","answer":"Oh, in the middle of the match? Sorry. Just try to get the muscle to relax.","person":"JAMIE HAMPTON"},{"question":"Massage?","answer":"Yeah, release my back.","person":"JAMIE HAMPTON"},{"question":"You hit a pretty outrageous curling‑back dropshot at 5‑4. Was that a desperation shot or something because you were hurting or something you typically try?","answer":"I think I hit that shot a lot in practice. And I hadn't made a dropshot yet, I don't think, so just trying to keep her on her on toes. It was the first point of the game. I really wanted to hold there, so threw something at her she probably wasn't expecting.","person":"JAMIE HAMPTON"},{"question":"Did you watch Madison yesterday?","answer":"I did.","person":"JAMIE HAMPTON"},{"question":"What were your impressions of that match?","answer":"Madison obviously has a lot of game, hits a really big ball, and has a bright future. Kerber, she runs like a champ.","person":"JAMIE HAMPTON"}]}
