AZARENKA/S. Kuznetsova\r\n      7‑5, 6‑1\r\n    \r\n    THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. \r\n    \r\n    Q.  What do you think was the key to the first set?  Was there a specific point?\r\n    SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  Well, today was a match, you know, I had to play with a top player, one of the best players at the moment.  These matches, you got to play very consistent.  This is what for the moment kills me after my break, is my consistency.  And I didn't serve well. \r\n    So this was two key points, I think, during the match what I didn't do well.  That's why I lost the match. \r\n    \r\n    Q.  You're doing a lot of sliding around out there, a lot of running.  How does the knee feel? \r\n    SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  Yeah, actually it was very good except first game of the second set.  I was really scared because I almost broke it again the same way I did it.  They say on the replay it look like my ankle, but my knee went backward, the same way, exactly.  Was like millimeters, very close, so I break it again the same way I did. \r\n    So I was really scared that moment.  I was a little bit freaking out because I didn't want to have another time off. \r\n    \r\n    Q.  But it felt fine after?\r\n    SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  So far it's all right because the time I broke it was straightaway I could not walk. \r\n    Today it was scary.  I was very close.  And, yeah, it was a bit frustrating for me.\r\n    \r\n    Q.  What part of the match was it?\r\n    SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  First game of the second set, my serve, when I landed. \r\n    \r\n    Q.  Do you feel far from your best level, or... \r\n    SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  I feel like I have game.  You know, I can play.  But I feel I need to improve my fitness, to improve my consistency, the serve. \r\n    There is things I have to improve, yeah, which is quite hard where I can be at. \r\n    \r\n    Q.  Overall are you happy with the performance in the tournament so far?\r\n    SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  I mean, if you win in first set 4‑1 and you lose, it's disappointed.  But overall I'm doing good.  After a long break, not so long time to preparation, I did quite well I think. \r\n    \r\n    Q.  For the whole Australian Open, are you happy progressing to the quarterfinal stage?\r\n    SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA:  Yeah, I played lot of matches in last week, in Sydney‑‑ well, two weeks already ago.  But then I played here quite good matches.  That's all I needed. \r\n    You know, now it's time to work consistency, to play every point.  Because the top players, you have very small chances to win the match, letting down some points very easy. \r\n    \r\n    FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports\r\n                \n          ","interview":[{"question":"What do you think was the key to the first set?
