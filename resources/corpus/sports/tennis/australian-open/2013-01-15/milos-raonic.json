{"sport":"Tennis","event":"AUSTRALIAN OPEN ","date":"2013-01-15","people":["Milos Raonic"],"interview":[{"question":"What happened in the first set? Obviously not your finest hour.","answer":"I don't think not my finest two and a half hours. No, I wasn't putting anything on the ball the whole match. I was playing a little bit tight. I sort of wasn't hitting freely. I was just letting him get in the points and get in the match.","person":"MILOS RAONIC"},{"question":"You did have stretches of playing reasonably well, I thought.","answer":"But never the right way. He gave me a lot of mistakes. And it was always similar sort of the third set. I had a lot of break chances in the third set, but I was always missing the first or second ball. Then I just started overthinking a little bit too much.","person":"MILOS RAONIC"},{"question":"And the second serve on the set point in the fourth set, just another day at the office?","answer":"That's how I know how to serve. I hope that's how it always goes.","person":"MILOS RAONIC"},{"question":"Did that affect you at all, the fact that you hit a let on the previous serve?","answer":"No. I was thinking to go wide, but I've been doing this serve the whole time. I haven't really been double‑faulting. I double‑faulted maybe early in the game, but on the deuce side. I wasn't double‑faulting at all on that side.","person":"MILOS RAONIC"},{"question":"Do you blame any of the erratic play on the pretty windy conditions?","answer":"No, the wind wasn't that bad, as bad as it seems. It was actually pretty okay to play. I just wasn't swinging freely, and then just the wind seem a lot worse than it is. My legs weren't moving, my arm wasn't moving, so the margin for error when I was swinging through the ball was much smaller.","person":"MILOS RAONIC"},{"question":"How do you explain not moving the arms?","answer":"First match. Just looking to get better and better. I think I played better against Giraldo last year in US Open, but I think it was same of the sort of the same situation. Then I came out better and better and better by the match. So happy to get through and trying to make it better.","person":"MILOS RAONIC"},{"question":"So it's Rosol or Jamie Baker.","answer":"I played Jamie I think three times, three weeks in a row, in futures in Bangkok. Three weeks in a row I played him. I think semis all three weeks. I won twice and lost once.","person":"MILOS RAONIC"},{"question":"Rosol is he anything but a guy that had one phenomenal performance?","answer":"That's not my place to comment. We'll see about that in two days.","person":"MILOS RAONIC"},{"question":"And what did you think of him today? Steady at certain times.","answer":"He's steady. He doesn't move that great. He needs time. That's why I felt I let him into it quite often, because I'm normally pretty good when I get ahead in the point making the guy go from side to side. Guys like Ferrer that defend really well I struggle with a bit more. I wasn't able to get him going, and that's the thing. I was letting him into the game. That's why I was a bit disappointed with, well, not just that part but many parts of the match.","person":"MILOS RAONIC"},{"question":"Trying to incorporate a few new things into your game this year. I guess you weren't too successful with that today.","answer":"No. The only thing I incorporated is winning the match and getting by and trying to be better.","person":"MILOS RAONIC"}]}
