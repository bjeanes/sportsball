{"sport":"Tennis","event":"AUSTRALIAN OPEN ","date":"2013-01-19","people":["Richard Gasquet"],"interview":[{"question":"How did you find that match for yourself?","answer":"I think I start very bad. I played not good at the start of the match. He was starting good, the condition was fast, so it was a bit difficult for me, especially with the wind. I feel not good in my forehand, and same with my backhand. A lot of tension. I was losing 6‑3, 3‑1 with a break point, so it could be very difficult for me if he's winning two sets zero. Then I fight and I return better. The third set was the key of the match, and I think in the fourth he was a little bit tired. But I fight as much as I could, and played well. At the end of the match I play better.","person":"RICHARD GASQUET"},{"question":"What can you say about your opponent? Is he a player to watch in the future?","answer":"I think he's a good player, but he's a good player. He's in the third round, so for sure he's tough to beat.","person":"RICHARD GASQUET"}]}
