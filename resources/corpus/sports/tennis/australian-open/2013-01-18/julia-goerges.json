She was serving for the match and you came back. Do you think she trembled?","answer":"No, I think these last four games, I think they were pretty good of myself. Well, overall it was a great match. I think we had tough rallies, good shots and good winners.Well, I stayed there the whole match. I knew I always have a chance to break her because her serve is not so huge. There is always a chance to fight back.I did it pretty well today.","person":"JULIA GOERGES"},{"question":"Did the rain bother you?","answer":"No, not really. It was just a little slippery at the very end, but that's all right.","person":"JULIA GOERGES"},{"question":"Can you talk about how do you think she played today, and also about your next match to play against Li Na?","answer":"As I said, I think it was a great match from both of us. It could have gone either way. I had the lucky end at the end, but, well, the next one is the same as today. It's a tough one. She's a Grand Slam champion, and I have to be there from the first second on.Well, you always have a chance to beat those players. I have done it before. Hopefully I can keep going like this.","person":"JULIA GOERGES"}]}
