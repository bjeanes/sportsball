So when I feel confident, I believe in me. Against Del Potro, I play a very good match. So it was good for my head. And today it was difficult after my win yesterday.

I win already against him, so it's good for the confidence when you go on court. Last year I play a perfect match against him. If I have to play against him again, it will be another match, a very tough match. So I have to continue on this way.

So it will be a tough match.","person":"JEREMY CHARDY"},{"question":"Do you think it will be harder in a best‑of‑five?","answer":"Yeah, it's more difficult because it's tough to win three sets in a row against big player. They have a chance to come back all the time, to change the game. I don't want to think too much about this match. I want to enjoy this one first. Tomorrow I have one day. No doubles, no singles, so it's good. I will be focused on my match against him or Simon tomorrow night.","person":"JEREMY CHARDY"},{"question":"Your first quarterfinal in a Grand Slam.

So I have to believe it.","person":"JEREMY CHARDY"},{"question":"There's so many exceptional French players. The focus is so much on Tsonga, on Gasquet.

So now I have to play more solid and to have many big win to be like them. So, no, for me I don't care about this. I just play.

I know if I play against him, I have to be very focused on my serve because it's very important. After every serve, I have to always take my chance because if I start to play a rally with him, I have no chance. I have to try always something on his game. Sometimes he miss something, or if I make a good shot after 30‑All or 15‑30, I have to take my chance all the time. I beat him like this. I breaked twice in the first set, and in the second I break him twice. I will try something. I play different every point. I think it's the way to beat him.","person":"JEREMY CHARDY"},{"question":"Could you tell us how important the academy and Patrick have been to your career.","answer":"I think it's very important for me because when I'm at the academy, I feel really like at home. Everybody is very nice with me. I have everything on the academy. Patrick can help me. I speak a lot with him. I have my coach, my physio, my fitness coach. So for me it's very important to have many people. I think we can choose the people with who I can work, I want to work. It's really important. I like my coach very much. It's like a friend, brother, I don't know. We are very near. I think it's important for me. When I play I have everybody on my box. It's good.

How were you able to keep your calm to get the job done today?","answer":"I feel confident on my game. It's always easier to be calm on the court. After I lose the first set, I say, Okay, I don't play very good today; I have to play more relax because I was nervous. When I start to hit my forehand, I start to feel confidence. Because when my forehand is here, my head is here, everything is here. So when I start to feel good on my forehand, I play more relax. After, the match change. After, I stay calm. I play solid. It was a good win.","person":"JEREMY CHARDY"}]}
