But finally I come back, no?","person":"DAVID FERRER"},{"question":"What was it in the first two sets? You never lost to him in 12 times, but suddenly he was winning.","answer":"Well, it's very difficult to win Nico, no? I think he played better than me in the first set. There was a break. I play bad in myself in one break. In the second, I didn't play good, no? In the third, I feel better with my game. I can play more aggressive. I think it was not a best match we are play together, no? But the important is the victory, and I win.","person":"DAVID FERRER"},{"question":"He served for the match another two or three times. Did you feel he was going to get nervous at that time? Wasn't he serving well enough to hold?","answer":"Well, maybe in the third set or in the fourth set, he was more tired than me. In one part of the court was the windy, no? I know that when I had windy for when I receive, I have a (indiscernible) windy, no? Is not easy sometimes to play in this center court. I'm always trying to do my best, to fight a lot. If I lost, I would like to lost fighting, no? Never give or am bad on mentally, my mind.","person":"DAVID FERRER"},{"question":"You've had some great comebacks before. Where do you put this one?","answer":"Oh, every match is different.

And in the fifth, he was cramping, problems with his leg, so it was easier for me.","person":"DAVID FERRER"},{"question":"You know Djokovic very well clearly. He may not ge through.

I think Wawrinka, he play one of the best matches of him. And he was close. Maybe the key was in the second set when he was 5‑2, no, in the second up. But Nole, he's a special player. He has everything shots. Finally in the fifth set, Djokovic was better physic than Wawrinka. Novak, I think now he's recovery, sure, because his physic is unbelievable. He's the best, I think. You know, every day is different: the weather, the conditions, everything is different. I don't know what is going to be tonight with Tomas Berdych, but I hope it will be a long match, no (smiling)?","person":"DAVID FERRER"},{"question":"You know Nico very well.

He will have the chance for will to do semifinal again. Of course, it's a bad day for him because he was close to win the match. He did quarterfinal. He's on fire. Improving his game.
