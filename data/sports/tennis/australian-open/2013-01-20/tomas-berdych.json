{"sport":"Tennis","event":"AUSTRALIAN OPEN ","date":"2013-01-20","people":["Tomas Berdych"],"interview":[{"question":"That was one heck of a tiebreak.","answer":"Oh, yeah. I mean, so far this year I didn't play any tiebreak, and this was the first one. Pretty good. So, yeah, I want to maybe enjoy that and stay there longer. No, no, no. I mean, I had many chances through all the set, and in the tiebreak as well. But, yeah, I mean, it's tough with him. Could be really about a few points. I'm glad I was able to hold my serve and then in the last point just made the point.","person":"TOMAS BERDYCH"},{"question":"Were you consciously really going for it in the tiebreak?","answer":"Well, I mean, from the beginning, yes. Then probably I was actually‑‑ yeah, that was definitely the tactics that I wants to keep through all the tiebreak. But especially actually I don't know the score, but there was two times that Kevin was serving second serve. Well, good second serve, but I was quite, you know, passive on my return, which I should go for it more a little bit. You know, I mean, risk it, try to get him under pressure little bit more. I didn't do so. He just made two clear winners from forehand. So, yeah, but it was kind of a tactic through the tiebreak, yes.","person":"TOMAS BERDYCH"},{"question":"Is it easier said than done? Those tiebreakers, there's a lot of pressure. To really go for it, it makes sense to be slightly passive. Is that the difference between the top four in those situations and everyone else?","answer":"Well, I think more fair is to say you should be able to bring your best game, you know, because as long as the set is keep going, why to play the best tennis when it's 1‑All. There is no sense. You will be 2‑1, and that's it. There's basically not much happen with that. So I think it's more important to bring the best for the end of the set, and I think I was able to do so. I was many times actually serving the set points down and was able to keep on my serve, which with him is very tough because you don't know what could happen, especially for your second serve. You can just go for it hundred percent and then you don't have it in your hands at all. Well, finally it didn't happen like that. I was able to made it, not to be there for the fourth set, possibly the fifth set.","person":"TOMAS BERDYCH"},{"question":"Would you say you're mentally strong?","answer":"Yeah, I would say that it's getting better and better. I mean, it's the kind of improvement since the first rounds. And even by this, it's much better than on beginning because of course you have many matches, confident, and everything felt good. So let's see.","person":"TOMAS BERDYCH"},{"question":"How do you feel this year compared to last year going into the quarterfinals, probably playing another big player?","answer":"Well, I would say I felt much better, you know. I mean, the last year was a pretty, I would say, big year for me. There were many new experience that I learned. You know, I hope that I'm gonna be able to profit from that. On the other hand last year I spend much more time on court. And, of course, every single piece of energy I'm going to need for the next match. So now I felt pretty good. I mean, I just play every single match by three sets. Everything was fine. I felt physically well. I hope that's actually now the big match gonna waiting for me.","person":"TOMAS BERDYCH"},{"question":"I think it was a backhand volley for two sets to love against Rafa. Could you have done anything differently with that shot?","answer":"Many people say that, yeah, backhand volley. I saw it couple of times in the TV. Still, I was the one on court playing the situation. Maybe it looks easier than the volley was. I mean, it was not something that, for example, I was missing with John Isner in the final in Winston‑Salem. That was an easy backhand volley which I will see for a couple of years (smiling). But, yeah, this one was a tough shot. You know, yeah, as Rafa has shown, great fighter. Yeah, he was playing really well. But, yeah, I mean, it was a good match. I like to get back in my memories for this match, yeah.","person":"TOMAS BERDYCH"},{"question":"You say you learnt a lot in the last year. Anything specific or in particular that you've discovered about yourself?","answer":"Every single day you discover something new. Every time that you just wake up, it's gonna be something new. But, no, in my tennis life, tennis career, it was many things. You know, even to play semifinal in US Open. That match with Andy Murray, even it doesn't go well, there was something what I could learn a lot from that. You know, then through whole year, playing the Davis Cup, those matches, playing in Argentina, it's not something you're going to get on regular tournament. Then the final. There was many, many things that's been new for me. It's always good to have as much as possible of the experience. Yeah, I learn some of them.","person":"TOMAS BERDYCH"},{"question":"Is that Davis Cup final still in your head? Do you still think about it a lot?","answer":"No, it's not. I mean, it's nice actually talk about it now, talk about it on the dinner, during the day. But once you coming for the court, even for the practice, it has to be over, you know, because the season started, new season start, and nobody actually care about that. It's done. We won that, and that's it. So now everything starts from the beginning again, and that's how it is.","person":"TOMAS BERDYCH"},{"question":"Did you see the match last night between Federer and Tomic?","answer":"Actually not much. I didn't see much. I just seen couple of points actually today from the tiebreak in the second set. I mean, no, it's tough to say something about it if you see like three, four points. It's tough. I would be cooking from nothing. Sorry.","person":"TOMAS BERDYCH"}]}
