RAONIC/J. Hajek\r\n  3‑6, 6‑1, 6‑2, 7‑6\r\n\r\nTHE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. \r\n\r\nQ.  What happened in the first set?  Obviously not your finest hour. \r\nMILOS RAONIC:  I don't think not my finest two and a half hours. \r\nNo, I wasn't putting anything on the ball the whole match.  I was playing a little bit tight.  I sort of wasn't hitting freely.  I was just letting him get in the points and get in the match.\r\n\r\nQ.  You did have stretches of playing reasonably well, I thought. \r\nMILOS RAONIC:  But never the right way.  He gave me a lot of mistakes. \r\nAnd it was always similar sort of the third set.  I had a lot of break chances in the third set, but I was always missing the first or second ball.  Then I just started overthinking a little bit too much. \r\n\r\nQ.  And the second serve on the set point in the fourth set, just another day at the office?\r\nMILOS RAONIC:  That's how I know how to serve.  I hope that's how it always goes. \r\n\r\nQ.  Did that affect you at all, the fact that you hit a let on the previous serve?\r\nMILOS RAONIC:  No.  I was thinking to go wide, but I've been doing this serve the whole time.  I haven't really been double‑faulting.  I double‑faulted maybe early in the game, but on the deuce side.  I wasn't double‑faulting at all on that side.\r\n\r\nQ.  Do you blame any of the erratic play on the pretty windy conditions? \r\nMILOS RAONIC:  No, the wind wasn't that bad, as bad as it seems.  It was actually pretty okay to play.  I just wasn't swinging freely, and then just the wind seem a lot worse than it is. \r\nMy legs weren't moving, my arm wasn't moving, so the margin for error when I was swinging through the ball was much smaller.\r\n\r\nQ.  How do you explain not moving the arms?\r\nMILOS RAONIC:  First match.  Just looking to get better and better.  I think I played better against Giraldo last year in US Open, but I think it was same of the sort of the same situation.  Then I came out better and better and better by the match. \r\nSo happy to get through and trying to make it better.\r\n\r\nQ.  So it's Rosol or Jamie Baker. \r\nMILOS RAONIC:  I played Jamie I think three times, three weeks in a row, in futures in Bangkok.  Three weeks in a row I played him.  I think semis all three weeks.  I won twice and lost once. \r\n\r\nQ.  Rosol is he anything but a guy that had one phenomenal performance?\r\nMILOS RAONIC:  That's not my place to comment.  We'll see about that in two days. \r\n\r\nQ.  And what did you think of him today?  Steady at certain times. \r\nMILOS RAONIC:  He's steady.  He doesn't move that great.  He needs time.  That's why I felt I let him into it quite often, because I'm normally pretty good when I get ahead in the point making the guy go from side to side. \r\nGuys like Ferrer that defend really well I struggle with a bit more.  I wasn't able to get him going, and that's the thing.  I was letting him into the game.  That's why I was a bit disappointed with, well, not just that part but many parts of the match.\r\n\r\nQ.  Trying to incorporate a few new things into your game this year.  I guess you weren't too successful with that today. \r\nMILOS RAONIC:  No.  The only thing I incorporated is winning the match and getting by and trying to be better. \r\n\r\nFastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            \n          ","interview":[{"question":"What happened in the first set?
