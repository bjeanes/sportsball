{"sport":"Tennis","event":"AUSTRALIAN OPEN ","date":"2013-01-24","people":["Novak Djokovic"],"interview":[{"question":"What does a performance like that do for your confidence going into Sunday night?","answer":"Well, it can only do positive things to my confidence. Definitely at this stage of a tournament, playing semifinals against the world No.4, somebody that I have respect for, great competitor, and being able to perform as well as I did, it's incredible. I have a great feeling about myself on the court at this moment. Now I have a two days off before the finals which gives me enough time to get ready, you know, and recover for the finals.","person":"NOVAK DJOKOVIC"},{"question":"Do you see your preparation for the final this year being a little bit different compared to last year? Do you prefer this?","answer":"I definitely prefer being fitter for the final and having a little bit more time than I had in 2012. It's quite different circumstances that I have to face this time. You know, last year I played five hours in semis and had only a day and a half to recover for another six hours with Nadal. This year it hasn't been the case, and I'm very glad. I was pushed to the limit in the fourth round. Had some really physically tough matches in this tournament, and I'm glad that I went through it. Right now I feel great on the court.","person":"NOVAK DJOKOVIC"},{"question":"Would you like to see tomorrow night be a long, drawn‑out match?","answer":"Yeah, sure. Why not? It's going to be a great match, obviously. They're great rivals and also best players in the world at this moment. They will definitely perform their best for sure in semifinals. I wouldn't rate anybody as a favorite. Just considering myself, I'll be ready for whoever I play against.","person":"NOVAK DJOKOVIC"},{"question":"Will you watch that game tomorrow night on TV as a tennis fan or mentally making notes?","answer":"Well, I think it's logical that I watch it with more attention because I'm going to play the winner of that match. So I'm going to do analysis and make the notes, as you say, and see whoever I play against to get the right tactics for the match.","person":"NOVAK DJOKOVIC"},{"question":"When you're watching it, if somebody hits a brilliant winner down the line, do you go, Whoa, great shot?","answer":"Of course, of course. I love tennis. Tennis is my life. I'm not just a player, I'm also a fan of this sport. I love to see these big matches. When Federer and Murray and Nadal are playing, those are the special kind of matches in Grand Slams. So hope to see something nice tomorrow night.","person":"NOVAK DJOKOVIC"},{"question":"Who would you rather play?","answer":"Have no preference.","person":"NOVAK DJOKOVIC"},{"question":"What kind of treatment did you give Leconte?","answer":"I was late because I gave a treatment to Leconte. The diagnosis we determined with my assistant is that he's definitely crazy. He needs a long‑term treatment (smiling).","person":"NOVAK DJOKOVIC"},{"question":"In all seriousness, did you watch the women's semifinal today between Victoria and Sloane?","answer":"No, I haven't seen it. I haven't seen it. Is there anything particular that I had to see?","person":"NOVAK DJOKOVIC"},{"question":"There was quite a controversy about a medical treatment late in the second set.","answer":"I haven't heard about that. Sorry.","person":"NOVAK DJOKOVIC"},{"question":"If you were to play Andy, would you take any confidence in the fact that after the US Open final you got a couple of wins against him at the end of last year? Would that be a boost?","answer":"That maybe might mentally help a bit, but it's not a big advantage. Whenever I play Andy or Roger or Rafa, the top rivals, it's always small margins and small details decide a winner, especially at this stage of a tournament. So, you know, it's finals. It's really unpredictable who is going to come out as a winner.","person":"NOVAK DJOKOVIC"},{"question":"When you go into a match against those guys, is it a different feeling going in mentally knowing you might have to be out there five hours?","answer":"You know, this two‑day break definitely serves me well, you know, physically, mentally, emotionally, so I can get all my strength for that final. I'm gonna be expecting‑‑ I have to be ready to expect a five‑hour match or five sets. That's the kind of approach that I have to every single match that I play on on Grand Slams, especially in the second week. No other thoughts than that one. And of course I'm going to try to go out on the court and win whoever I have across the net.","person":"NOVAK DJOKOVIC"},{"question":"Do you make use of anything like that pressurized egg chamber which you were known to use at the US Open? Do you have one of them out here in Australia at all?","answer":"No. No, I don't.","person":"NOVAK DJOKOVIC"}]}
