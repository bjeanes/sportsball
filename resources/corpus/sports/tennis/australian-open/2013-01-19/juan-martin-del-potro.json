CHARDY/J. Del Potro\r\n  6‑3, 6‑3, 6‑7, 3‑6, 6‑3\r\n\r\nTHE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. \r\n\r\nQ.  How disappointing is this after coming back from two sets down to level the match and lose in the fifth?\r\nJUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:  Yeah, of course is not a good result after come back two set down.  But Jeremy plays really well in the fifth set.  He deserve to win the match.  He broke me my serve. \r\nHe was so calm to close the match in the end.  The tournament for me is over now.  I have to work hard because the season just started.  I believe in my game, myself.  I will work very, very hard for the future. \r\n\r\nQ.  Did you feel you played the same today as you did in the first two matches?\r\nJUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:  Well, the match was really tough.  Jeremy play so strong during four hours.  He serves well.  He made a lot of winners with the forehand, very good slices. \r\nIn the end when he had the chance to break me, he did.  I think that was the key.  In the end, he play better in the important moments, and he took the chance to win the match. \r\n\r\nQ.  Were you feeling okay?  You had a chat to the doctor at one stage. \r\nJUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:  No, yeah, I'm feeling okay.\r\n\r\nQ.  What was that about?\r\nJUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:  No, just to talk a little bit with the doctors about my body.  But not any problem. \r\n\r\nQ.  It seemed like you started a little bit slowly.  Did you feel that?\r\nJUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:  No.  I mean, the first two sets, he broke me my serve twice.  He made better game than me in the first two sets. \r\nThen I had luck in the third when I won the tiebreak.  In the fourth I play better.  But in the end, when he has the chance to break me, he did. \r\nI repeat:  he deserve to win the match in the end. \r\n\r\nQ.  What have you got coming up next?  Can you talk about some of your goals for the rest of the year?\r\nJUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:  I'm going to play in Europe:  Rotterdam, Marseille, Dubai. \r\nThe goals are the same.  The season just started.  This is my first tournament.  I would love to be in the top five as soon as I can.  But it's a long road, and all the players are playing really well. \r\nBut, anyways, I will try to do it.\r\n\r\nQ.  Does today really show the depth of men's tennis?\r\nJUAN MARTIN DEL POTRO:  Yeah, all players are so good.  Seppi beat Cilic.  Berankis made a good match against Murray.  Tipsarevic won two matches in the fifth set. \r\nAll the players are dangerous for us and everything can happen.  Jeremy plays really well and he beat me.  Maybe Tomic has the chance to do it with the match tonight. \r\nBut this is sport, and I like when the competition are so high level. \r\n\r\nFastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            \n          ","interview":[{"question":"How disappointing is this after coming back from two sets down to level the match and lose in the fifth?","answer":"Yeah, of course is not a good result after come back two set down.
