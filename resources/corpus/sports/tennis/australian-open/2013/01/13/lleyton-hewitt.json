\r\nLLEYTON HEWITT:  You know, I just take it one match at a time.  It's the same as anyone out there.  To win seven best‑of‑five‑set matches isn't easy on any surface.  Obviously, I came really close in 2005. \r\nYeah, especially the first week, try to get through the first week and see if I can put myself in a position to be there in the second week. \r\nYeah, you never know.  Strange things happen with draws, stuff opening up.  I have a tough first up tomorrow, hopefully I can get through that tomorrow and go forward from there.\r\n\r\nQ.  With you and Bernard in good form, do you think our Australian Open hopes are as good as they have been in recent years?\r\nLLEYTON HEWITT:  Yeah, obviously we're both hitting the ball well, but we're both unseeded, too.  We probably had higher expectations when myself, Philippoussis and Rafter were in the top 10, top 15 in the world, and seeded at the majors. \r\nBut obviously with how the Australian rankings have been the last four or five years, yeah, we're both hitting the ball well, obviously confident coming in.\r\n\r\nQ.  On Bernard, with the form he's in at the moment, how far do you think he can progress?\r\nLLEYTON HEWITT:  In this tournament, I don't know.  Obviously he's got Roger in the third round.  He's had good matches with Roger, but Roger has always been a class above in all their matchups so far. \r\nBernie still has to get through one match at a time.  He can't take anyone lightly, and I don't think he will anyway.  But, yeah, it will be an interesting match now playing Roger now that he's got a bit of confidence as well.\r\n\r\nQ.  Do you enjoy, compared to when you were younger and higher ranked, the anonymity, maybe not anonymity, but the fact there's another young player that takes a lot of the media focus?\r\nLLEYTON HEWITT:  Yeah, doesn't really worry me (smiling). \r\nOnce I go out to play, it's not even in your mind.  You do all the preparation.  I'm so used to it now anyway, sort of been in the spotlight, played big matches in Grand Slams and everything, it's second nature to you.  You don't even worry about it.\r\n\r\nQ.  Taking yourself out of the tournament, who do you like to win the tournament?\r\nLLEYTON HEWITT:  Well, I don't know.  Obviously the top three guys are the main guys.  There's no doubt about it. \r\nMurray obviously is going to be pretty confident.  He had a great finish to the year last year.  He won his first major, which the monkey is sort of off his back now.  He can sort of go out there and play with a lot less pressure and expectation to win that first one.  He's going to be tough to beat. \r\nNovak, the way he bounced back last year for the semi and final, he's going to be confident when he gets back out on Rod Laver Arena, as well. \r\nThose two guys, the two guys I beat, Berdych and Del Potro, there's a handful of guys with a realistic chance.\r\n\r\nQ.  The crowd will be behind you.  Do you need to block that out or do you soak it up?\r\nLLEYTON HEWITT:  I just use it to my advantage when I need to, I guess.  It gets the adrenaline going.  I enjoy being in that situation.  Obviously I'd rather 15,000 barracking for me than against me. \r\nNo, I enjoy it.\r\n\r\nQ.  Do the night sessions suit you?\r\nLLEYTON HEWITT:  Doesn't really bother me.  I don't think tomorrow's going to be that hot playing during the day.  It's probably not going to be a massive difference.  If it was going to be a hot day during the day, sometimes it can be a difference at night playing in heavier conditions.  But I don't think tomorrow will be a big deal.\r\n\r\nQ.  Are you happy with the court speed?\r\nLLEYTON HEWITT:  Yeah, no.  So far I've hit on Rod Laver quite a few times.  I'm hitting the ball all right.  Can't change it now. \r\n\r\nQ.  What do you think of the new facility for Australian players?\r\nLLEYTON HEWITT:  The new facility is fantastic.  It's great.  The young Australian players are very fortunate to have such a great facility to train in and recovery, everything.  It's awesome over there. \r\nYeah, you just don't want to be complacent and think they get that everywhere they go.  They still have to do the tough yards to make it and not get everything handed to them. \r\nYeah, the facilities are second to none. \r\n\r\nFastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            \n          ","interview":[{"question":"How are you feeling after yesterday?
