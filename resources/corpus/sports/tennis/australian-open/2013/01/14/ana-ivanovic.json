IVANOVIC/M. Czink\r\n  6‑2, 6‑1\r\n\r\nTHE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. \r\n\r\nQ.  Are you happy with your performance today? \r\nANA IVANOVIC:  Well, to be honest, I expected tough match because we played few times in the past.  I also lost once against her. \r\nI really wanted to make sure I work hard for each point and try to take away time for her because she likes to strike the ball and counter‑punch and use the pace of opponents. \r\nI was really pleased with my performance overall today.\r\n\r\nQ.  How do you feel about the second round?\r\nANA IVANOVIC:  It's a Grand Slam.  You want to take it one match at a time.  It's great I have a day in between to reset and prepare and plan for the next round. \r\nThere is no easy matches.  But it's a challenge.  I enjoy it.  I really hope I can perform well. \r\n\r\nQ.  With preparation, the beginning of the year, do you feel you can go to the end in a Grand Slam like this?\r\nANA IVANOVIC:  It's hard talking about it after first round. \r\nLast year, quarterfinals of US Open was the first time I play quarters since winning French Open.  So it's very hard talking about winning. \r\nBut I definitely feel my game, it's at a higher level than it was.  There is tough opponents out there, lots of girls playing well.  I feel like I can challenge all of them. \r\nIt's going to be a good test to see how far I can go. \r\n\r\nQ.  How do you feel your serve is going at the moment?  Are you feeling confident with it?\r\nANA IVANOVIC:  Yeah, no, it's still a work in progress.  Actually last week in Perth it was really good for most of the matches.  I was very pleased with that. \r\nIn practice it's always perfect.  In matches it gets away from you sometimes.  It's kind of normal. \r\nI try not to think too much about it, take my time for the next one.  Many times if I have a bad toss, I serve a good serve the next one.  Like I said, that's a work in progress.  I'm happy I'm making more first serves and it's more aggressive, too.\r\n\r\nQ.  Your ankle is okay? \r\nANA IVANOVIC:  Well, I'm definitely going to put some ice and do some treatments on it tonight.  Hopefully it's fine.  It didn't swell. \r\n\r\nFastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            \n          ","interview":[{"question":"Are you happy with your performance today?","answer":"Well, to be honest, I expected tough match because we played few times in the past.
