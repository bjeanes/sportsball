JANKOVIC/J. Larsson\r\n  6‑2, 6‑2\r\n\r\nTHE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. \r\n\r\nQ.  How did you feel out there?  Pretty convincing win. \r\nJELENA JANKOVIC:  Yeah, actually the conditions were quite tough.  I felt the wind was swirling, and it wasn't easy controlling the points.  So I had to move a lot. \r\nYou know, as well, the first matches are never easy.  I didn't know really my opponent.  It was our first match against each other. \r\nSo I did enough to win.  But obviously there was a lot of things that I could have done better, that I've done well. \r\nIt's okay.  For the first win, I'm happy to get through.  It's never easy playing an opponent you don't know in conditions like this. \r\n\r\nQ.  Are you icing something there right now?\r\nJELENA JANKOVIC:  Yeah, my back hurts.  That's all. \r\n\r\nQ.  One of the matches that got a lot of attention when the draw came out was a third‑round match possibly between you and Ana Ivanovic.  Have you thought about that match?\r\nJELENA JANKOVIC:  No, to be honest I'm not thinking too far ahead.  I just want to go one match at a time. \r\nWe both have to go there, you know, to reach third round.  So one match at a time and we see how it goes. \r\nI really don't want to focus like who is in my third round or semifinal first.  Let's see how it goes. \r\n\r\nQ.  What is your coaching situation now?\r\nJELENA JANKOVIC:  Right now I have one coach from the United States, and we just working and trying to get back in form, in the shape.  My goal is to get to the top again.\r\n\r\nQ.  What's his name?\r\nJELENA JANKOVIC:  Diego. \r\n\r\nFastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            \n          ","interview":[{"question":"How did you feel out there?
