BERDYCH/M. Russell\r\n  6‑3, 7‑5, 6‑3\r\n\r\nTHE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. \r\n\r\nQ.  How was that for your first match?\r\nTOMAS BERDYCH:  Well, it was quite all right, I would say.  You know, he's a really tough opponent, especially for the conditions that's been there for today.  It's even tougher. \r\nYeah, I mean, it was three sets.  I was able to even get the rhythm to play again for the three sets.  Otherwise not to stay that long on court, as well, which is also positive, especially from the beginning to be able to save some energy. \r\nSo, yeah, I mean, I can find also I would say the one part of the game which I didn't like that much, you know, when I was 3‑Love up, had a breakpoint, didn't make it, 3‑1, 40‑15, lost my serve.  That was kind of not a good time. \r\nBut, yeah, I was able to finish it up. \r\n\r\nQ.  Is it at all difficult for you when everybody always talks about the very, very top few players; no one talks about you, David Ferrer, Jo‑Wilfried Fred Tsonga.  How do you go into a tournament, thinking I can win this?\r\nTOMAS BERDYCH:  I think this doesn't make that much difference.  Or I would say it's maybe even better for myself.  I mean, let's leave all the pressure on them.  You know, everybody's talking how many Grand Slams this guy can win, that one. \r\nI mean, you get so much pressure on the court, and you don't have to have it around, as well. \r\nYeah, once the day's going to come, all right.  That's how the situation is.  Once if it's different, I mean, it's how it is.  I mean, the other hand, yeah, those four guys, they were able to win Grand Slams, many Grand Slams.  So probably they deserve it more than us so far. \r\n\r\nQ.  Do you ever sort of go into a Grand Slam thinking, Something really strange has to happen for me to have a chance to win, or is it just about how well you can play yourself?\r\nTOMAS BERDYCH:  Well, I wouldn't say 'strange,' but if you look at the draw, if you want to win the slam, you have to beat at least three of them, then it's really tough, so...  Maybe you were finding for this word 'strange.' \r\nThat's how it is.  Today's tennis is really, really strong.  I think we were in the best era of our sport ever.  That's how it is. \r\nI mean, it's the same for everybody.  I think we all try our best to, you know, break that huge barrier in front of us.  You know, let's see. \r\nI mean, if this happened once at least, then it would be I would say like at least 10 times better than it was before.  You know, let's see. \r\n\r\nQ.  You were very close in New York to making that final. \r\nTOMAS BERDYCH:  Yeah, you know.  But that's how it is, you know.  I beat one guy.  Then there was another waiting.  In the final was another one, as well. \r\nYou know, the semis, I mean, yeah, I don't like to talk about it once more again because, you know, everybody see how it was.  You know, it doesn't help to my game at all. \r\nBut, you know, I was trying to fight with that.  You know, it's not only about how well you play, but you also need something to add extra, you know, even if the luck, some other things, then the big result can happen. \r\n\r\nFastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            \n          ","interview":[{"question":"How was that for your first match?","answer":"Well, it was quite all right, I would say.
