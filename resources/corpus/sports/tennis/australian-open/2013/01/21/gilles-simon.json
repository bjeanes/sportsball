MURRAY/G. Simon\r\n      6‑3, 6‑1, 6‑3\r\n    \r\n    THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. \r\n    \r\n    Q.  How much of Saturday night's match played a part in tonight's result, the fatigue?\r\n    GILLES SIMON:  I don't know.  It was just difficult for me today.  I knew it before.  But I think I just did all I could for the last two days to be able to play this one. \r\n    It was a painful hour and a half on the court.  But, you know, Andy is anyway a very good player so it's always very hard to beat him.  Without being 100% you have almost no chance to do it. \r\n    I just wanted to do my best at any moment.  But it was getting worse and worse on the court.  It was a really difficult day. \r\n    \r\n    Q.  Was there any point where you thought you might not turn up on court or pull out during the match? \r\n    GILLES SIMON:  No, I wanted to play it.  I mean, it's part of the game.  A slam is a very long event, long match sometimes. \r\n    It was my job to be in a better shape today and to win the match before not playing 4 hours and 45 minutes.  One more time, I knew it would be difficult today, but it's just the way it is. \r\n    \r\n    Q.  How do you think he's playing?\r\n    GILLES SIMON:  It's difficult to say.  I didn't make him work a lot.  I just can say that he was missing his forehand at the end.  He was going for the winners every time. \r\n    But, no, it's difficult.  It's not easy for him also because there is no intensity.  So sometimes I'm playing two good shots, and then I give two games in a row.  So it's very difficult for him to play his tennis. \r\n    From what I saw from early on, I think he's in a good shape. \r\n    \r\n    Q.  What did you have to do in the last 24 hours to be able to play this match? \r\n    GILLES SIMON:  Yesterday I was just biking 20 minutes, you know, stretching, massage, cold bath.  I did everything I could.  But it's difficult when you run a marathon two days before to go for one more two days after. \r\n    \r\n    Q.  What percent do you think you were at today? \r\n    GILLES SIMON:  Oh, I don't know.  Very low. \r\n    \r\n    Q.  He's playing Jeremy Chardy in the next round.  Do you think there's a chance of an upset there?\r\n    GILLES SIMON:  Well, the last match I saw between them, Jeremy won it.  It's gonna be a match completely different.  Jeremy's very aggressive.  He has a huge serve, huge forehand.  He's able to hit some winners at any moment. \r\n    It's going to be difficult for him also to recover from all the match he played.  But Andy will have, of course, his chance to win.  But it's gonna be interesting to see the beginning of the match, because if Jeremy manage to win maybe the first set, then I think everything can happen. \r\n    \r\n    FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n                \n          ","interview":[{"question":"How much of Saturday night's match played a part in tonight's result, the fatigue?","answer":"I don't know.
