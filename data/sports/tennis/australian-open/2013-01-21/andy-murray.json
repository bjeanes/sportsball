{"sport":"Tennis","event":"AUSTRALIAN OPEN ","date":"2013-01-21","people":["Andy Murray"],"interview":[{"question":"A strange match in some respects. You realized that Gilles' condition wasn't great. How did you approach it?","answer":"Yeah, I mean, it was kind of tough. A tough situation for both players ‑ more obviously for him. You know, after the first few games, I mean, it didn't feel like that competitive. Sort of at this stage of a Grand Slam you're sort of G'd up and prepared for a tough battle. That's why it becomes hard because the emotions aren't quite into it. You're not quite necessarily feeling pressure, but you're wanting to try to finish the match as quickly as possible. It was quite a tough situation for both.","person":"ANDY MURRAY"},{"question":"Are you quite happy in the fact you got the job done pretty efficiently?","answer":"Yeah. I mean, I think it was kind of always going be that way. I felt after the first few games, because he wasn't serving hard at all, you know, his forehand side wasn't moving that well either. It was just about trying to finish the match as quickly as I could and then getting ready for the next one.","person":"ANDY MURRAY"},{"question":"Any concern you haven't been as tested as much as you would have liked?","answer":"Who knows. I mean, he got tested very hard in his last round and couldn't compete today. You can look at it both ways. You just got to work hard on the days off, practice all the things that you need to do better, hope that when the time comes that when you're tested you play better. But I think this week, the first few matches, like against Berankis, I think almost every single time when I've been broken, I've broken straight back, which is a good sign. Hope I can keep that up.","person":"ANDY MURRAY"},{"question":"What do you recall about the Chardy match? Did you see any of it today? The Cincinnati match.","answer":"I played him quite a few times. We grew up around the same time in juniors. Know each other pretty well. The Cincinnati match was disappointing from my side. I normally play quite well against him. But he's playing good tennis. I mean, he's had some big wins this week. He serves well. He's very aggressive off his forehand. His backhand is his weaker side, for sure. He hits a lot of slice, doesn't come over it too much. He likes to come forward. He can be erratic. But when his game is on, like it's been the last few rounds, he's a very tough player to play because he doesn't give you too much rhythm. And, yeah, he really goes for it.","person":"ANDY MURRAY"},{"question":"Did you watch much of Novak's match last night?","answer":"I saw maybe three points. I didn't hardly see any of it.","person":"ANDY MURRAY"},{"question":"You're aware of the story this morning suggesting the male players may boycott the US Open due to issues over prize money and a Monday final.","answer":"I didn't know about the story. Where did that come from? (Smiling.)","person":"ANDY MURRAY"},{"question":"Heard in the locker room or...","answer":"Since the player meeting, I haven't discussed with any of the players what was said there, what the plans are. But I know that the ATP are not particularly happy with the Monday final. I know that's an issue because however much revenue they make from having an extra day on their tournament hasn't really reflected in the increase in the prize money. That was what the players wanted, was obviously better prize money but not with an extra day to the event. I think that's what they're disappointed with. But I personally haven't spoken with anyone about boycotting the event.","person":"ANDY MURRAY"},{"question":"You're playing another Frenchman now. He beat you the last time you played in Cincinnati. Considering that you were not in your best shape after the Olympic Games, does it make any significance for you?","answer":"The match in Cincinnati?","person":"ANDY MURRAY"},{"question":"Yes.","answer":"Well, I hope it maybe motivates me more. But I think that's why you need to make sure you put a lot of emphasis in every match on the tour. Like I said, I played well against him in the past. If you go into a match, you don't play particularly well, you lose to a guy like Jeremy, when you play them in the fourth round or a quarterfinals of a slam, whatever, you know, they'll go into the match with a bit more confidence. So it's relevant in that respect. But different conditions here. Hope I can play a better match from my side.","person":"ANDY MURRAY"},{"question":"Would you support a boycott of the US Open if it came to that?","answer":"I don't want to go into that here at all. Not the place for it. Got the second week of a slam to focus on. Can discuss that after the event.","person":"ANDY MURRAY"}]}
