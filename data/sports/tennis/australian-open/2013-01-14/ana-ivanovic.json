{"sport":"Tennis","event":"AUSTRALIAN OPEN ","date":"2013-01-14","people":["Ana Ivanovic"],"interview":[{"question":"Are you happy with your performance today?","answer":"Well, to be honest, I expected tough match because we played few times in the past. I also lost once against her. I really wanted to make sure I work hard for each point and try to take away time for her because she likes to strike the ball and counterâ€‘punch and use the pace of opponents. I was really pleased with my performance overall today.","person":"ANA IVANOVIC"},{"question":"How do you feel about the second round?","answer":"It's a Grand Slam. You want to take it one match at a time. It's great I have a day in between to reset and prepare and plan for the next round. There is no easy matches. But it's a challenge. I enjoy it. I really hope I can perform well.","person":"ANA IVANOVIC"},{"question":"With preparation, the beginning of the year, do you feel you can go to the end in a Grand Slam like this?","answer":"It's hard talking about it after first round. Last year, quarterfinals of US Open was the first time I play quarters since winning French Open. So it's very hard talking about winning. But I definitely feel my game, it's at a higher level than it was. There is tough opponents out there, lots of girls playing well. I feel like I can challenge all of them. It's going to be a good test to see how far I can go.","person":"ANA IVANOVIC"},{"question":"How do you feel your serve is going at the moment? Are you feeling confident with it?","answer":"Yeah, no, it's still a work in progress. Actually last week in Perth it was really good for most of the matches. I was very pleased with that. In practice it's always perfect. In matches it gets away from you sometimes. It's kind of normal. I try not to think too much about it, take my time for the next one. Many times if I have a bad toss, I serve a good serve the next one. Like I said, that's a work in progress. I'm happy I'm making more first serves and it's more aggressive, too.","person":"ANA IVANOVIC"},{"question":"Your ankle is okay?","answer":"Well, I'm definitely going to put some ice and do some treatments on it tonight. Hopefully it's fine. It didn't swell.","person":"ANA IVANOVIC"}]}
