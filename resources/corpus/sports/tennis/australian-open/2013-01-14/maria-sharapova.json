{"sport":"Tennis","event":"AUSTRALIAN OPEN ","date":"2013-01-14","people":["Maria Sharapova"],"interview":[{"question":"I take it the rust didn't hurt too much out there?","answer":"Yeah, after a couple of close games and a few break points, certainly started to concentrate a bit better. And, you know, I didn't want to focus on the fact I hadn't played a lot of matches. Just wanted to focus on just what was ahead of me and really concentrate and, you know, be aggressive. I also never faced her before again.So it was just one of those matches where I didn't try to worry about her too much. I just tried to, you know, think about what I had to do.","person":"MARIA SHARAPOVA"},{"question":"You have now gotten a double bagel win at every slam. It completes your double bagel slam or calendar slam. Is that something you're proud of?","answer":"I don't think that's very relative to anything. (Laughter.)You know, when you're out there and playing, you're just focusing on every point and every game and trying to win as many as you can, and today was just a good scoreline.","person":"MARIA SHARAPOVA"},{"question":"You don't get any extra satisfaction out of 0‑0?","answer":"No, if you win 7‑6 in the third, you still won the match.","person":"MARIA SHARAPOVA"},{"question":"Did you take anything from today as far as what you want to work on maybe the next couple of days as far as you felt like you did something really well or that you weren't necessarily happy with?","answer":"I always do, because it's tough to feel completely satisfied. You always want to improve on things and work on certain things that you feel will help you in the later rounds certainly towards the end of the second week.But, yeah, overall I was happy with the way I started, considering I didn't play any matches coming in.","person":"MARIA SHARAPOVA"},{"question":"You got through round one in 55 minutes without losing a game. Must be a wonderful feeling for you. Are you already aware that Venus Williams played five more minutes and lost only one game?","answer":"I don't really think time matters and the scorelines; we both went out to play matches today and we both won. That's the bottom line.","person":"MARIA SHARAPOVA"},{"question":"You aren't aware that you may have to face her in the third round?","answer":"I have seen the draw, yes. Thank you.","person":"MARIA SHARAPOVA"},{"question":"On the court it's cold or hot?","answer":"Cold or hot?","person":"MARIA SHARAPOVA"},{"question":"What's your feeling?","answer":"You were there. Did you watch?","person":"MARIA SHARAPOVA"},{"question":"Yeah, I watched.","answer":"Was it cold or hot?","person":"MARIA SHARAPOVA"},{"question":"Cold.","answer":"Cold? It's probably warmer when you're playing. I felt pretty good, much colder than the other days.","person":"MARIA SHARAPOVA"}]}
