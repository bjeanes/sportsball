IVANOVIC/J. Jankovic\r\n  7‑5, 6‑3\r\n\r\nTHE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. \r\n\r\nQ.  Can't play much better than that, Ana?\r\nANA IVANOVIC:  Yeah, I'm very happy.  It was tough match.  I think it was intense from the first to the last moment, but I really felt like I stayed in the zone and I played each point for, you know, for that point. \r\nThat's what was my goal today, so I'm very pleased I managed to do that and to do it well.\r\n\r\nQ.  What happened in the first set?\r\nANA IVANOVIC:  What do you mean? \r\n\r\nQ.  At the service, I mean.  You was 5‑2. \r\nANA IVANOVIC:  Okay, well, the same way I got to 5‑2 I got to 5‑All.  Didn't happen much.  I think she played some good points. \r\nI don't know, was it 5‑4 when I was serving at 30‑Love, I had made a loose double fault and that cost me, I think, that game. \r\nShe played well?  She strike the ball well.  You know, I'm very, very happy I managed to come back from Love‑40 down in 5‑4. I think that was huge game, and then again from 15‑40 in the next service game. \r\nJust very pleased overall.\r\n\r\nQ.  A few years ago that would have been a semifinal maybe a final of a Grand Slam.  Does playing her still have the same intensity for you?\r\nANA IVANOVIC:  It definitely does.  Playing every opponent, I mean, we did play French Open '08 and then here we were both in the semifinals in '08, so if definitely brings a lot of memories.\r\nWe haven't played each other in a Grand Slam for a while, but it's always tough.  She's still very good player, and even though we are different opponents now than we were then, still it's a battle, and every match you want to win.\r\n\r\nQ.  How is your relationship with her now these days?\r\nANA IVANOVIC:  It's fine.  It's really good.  We had really good week in Prague for the final of the Fed Cup.  Yeah, we were hanging out a lot, you know, joking.  It's nice.  We know each other for a while. \r\nThis morning I was thinking it's my ninth Aussie Open.  It's scary. \r\n\r\nQ.  There was a bit of an edge there, though, between you two?\r\nANA IVANOVIC:  I think it's competitiveness, and you have that with everyone you play, and especially someone coming from your country.  At the time we were both, you know, looking for No. 1 position and to win a Grand Slam. \r\nYou know, of course there is going to be rivalry, but I think there is healthy rivalry, too, because you kind of push each other.\r\n\r\nQ.  You have an 8‑3 record against her.  Against some other players you don't do that well.  Is it because of the intensity of the rivalry?  Is it something special within it that helps you focus more when you play her?\r\nANA IVANOVIC:  I think it's also the style of the games, and, I mean, there is no secret.  Today's game, it's also a lot mental.  With some players you feel better; with others you don't.\r\nI think that also shows a little, but, you know, yeah, like I said, I think it's also the style of the game that really suits me when I can be patient and take my time.\r\n\r\nQ.  So you have had a lot of different ways you have approached fitness over the years.  Now you're thinner but you look a lot faster.  Do you feel like movement is much more important to you than maybe upper body strength?\r\nANA IVANOVIC:  I'm still working on my upper body strength.  I think in the offseason I really did improve a lot in my fitness.  I feel overall a lot more stable on the court and a lot more powerful as well.  I think my strokes are heavier, as well, and that's something I worked on a lot.\r\nI'm happy to see the results, and I definitely move a lot better and faster.   Still, there is a lot of room for improvement, but, you know, some things take time.  But I'm very, very happy that this hard work is paying off.\r\n\r\nQ.  Was it a deliberate decision to lose a little bit of weight?  Was that what you were thinking to do?\r\nANA IVANOVIC:  Well, you know, it was really up and down for me.  But it's not so much about the weight, it's just about the muscle and just getting the right balance, you know, because still you need to feel light on the court but you have to be powerful. \r\nThis is also my style of game.  I'm very powerful player.  I still need to improve on my upper body strength.  I had a really tough match the other day, and today I came out and I was feeling fine and was explosive.\r\nSo I'm very, very pleased that, like I said, it's paying off.  But, you know, I'm still working at it.\r\n\r\nQ.  Do you get more support here with your Australian connections than you would at other slams like Wimbledon and US Open?\r\nANA IVANOVIC:  Yeah, definitely, definitely. \r\nIn French, also, because I won there in the past.  But here I really feel the crowd is behind me.  It does help a lot in the tough moments.  You know, you have your adrenaline kicking in when they are sort of cheering loud and singing songs.  It is very special. \r\nI enjoy it a lot.\r\n\r\nQ.  And you still have the uncle in Beaumaris? \r\nANA IVANOVIC:  Mentone.\r\n\r\nQ.  Mentone.  Have you caught up with him?\r\nANA IVANOVIC:  Yeah, yeah, definitely.  They come every day.  He has a birthday next week, so he's like, Please stay here until my birthday.\r\n\r\nQ.  Given the lack of Australian representation in the women, i.e., none, would you be our kind of... \r\nANA IVANOVIC:  Thank you for offer.  I'd be happy.  I think people here are so lovely so I love coming here.  It's my favorite Grand Slam.  I'm so happy it's the beginning of the year so I can come even earlier.\r\n\r\nQ.  Radwanska hasn't lost a set I think in 12 matches.  First three times you played her you beat her, and I think she's won the last four.  Can you just talk about her development as a player and then the matchup?\r\nANA IVANOVIC:  Yeah, she definitely matured a lot as a player.  She was always a very tough competitor.  She has style of game that, you know, she doesn't give you much and you really have to work for your points. \r\nBeing patient is going to be a key.  It's going to be tough, for sure.  I have to be prepared to work hard for my points and to keep on putting pressure on her.\r\nBut, you know, it's just, again, working hard and just staying in the moment.  I will go over the tactics a little more with my coach today and tomorrow, and, you know, hopefully we can have a good match.\r\nBut it's going to be, again, balance of, you know, being aggressive enough and then still patient enough. \r\n\r\nQ.  Are you playing Fed Cup or undecided?\r\nANA IVANOVIC:  Yeah.  At the moment, yes. \r\n\r\nQ.  Yes?  Unless you win the tournament which you're counting on anyway? \r\nANA IVANOVIC:  Yeah, exactly. \r\n\r\nFastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            \n          ","interview":[{"question":"Can't play much better than that, Ana?","answer":"Yeah, I'm very happy.
