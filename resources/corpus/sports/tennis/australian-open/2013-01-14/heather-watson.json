{"sport":"Tennis","event":"AUSTRALIAN OPEN ","date":"2013-01-14","people":["Heather Watson"],"interview":[{"question":"Must be pretty proud of that.","answer":"Hmm. Well, not really. At the beginning I definitely wasn't there. I wasn't playing well. I didn't have much energy today. I don't know what it was. I think I'm going to go see the doctor after. But when I started cramping, you know, I had to start hitting the ball because I couldn't move. I'm kind of thankful that I did cramp today, otherwise I don't know how that would have ended up.","person":"HEATHER WATSON"},{"question":"Was your elbow giving you fits?","answer":"No, my elbow was fine today. It's just because I haven't been serving a lot. I didn't really have my timing. It felt fine. I maybe felt it on one serve, but it was fine. I think I was struggling with the wind a bit at the beginning and my timing, but then I got into it.","person":"HEATHER WATSON"},{"question":"What was the treatment you had?","answer":"On my elbow?","person":"HEATHER WATSON"},{"question":"When the trainer came out.","answer":"It was the trainer and the doctor, and I just told them how I was feeling, if there was anything I could take, what I should be doing, 'cause I was feeling quite faint. I didn't have any energy today. There was nothing I could really do. She actually had two timeouts, so during that time I just ate like two bananas, some gels, drunk loads. I think having that little sit‑down, I got a little recharged and motivated.","person":"HEATHER WATSON"},{"question":"It seemed to help that she called the trainer. She waited a few minutes, then called the trainer. It gave you recovery time.","answer":"Yeah. I think that did help me. And, like I said, it gave me time to eat, get some fuel in me and just get recharged.","person":"HEATHER WATSON"},{"question":"Had you felt like that all day?","answer":"Literally it was when I walked on the court. In the warmup I wasn't sharp. I don't know what it was.","person":"HEATHER WATSON"},{"question":"Could it just be something like, because you haven't played for a little while, not frustration, but you're waiting to play, perhaps you get a little too nervous about the occasion and it all gets to you a little bit?","answer":"Maybe. And the match before was a long one, and we never knew when we were going on. So I was warming up for like two hours.","person":"HEATHER WATSON"},{"question":"When did you actually start cramping?","answer":"It was actually after we had the timeout, when I came back on, hit a few balls. I just felt it going. I knew I couldn't move. I couldn't, you know, be too tense, so I just loosened up on everything and just hit it. And I'm just so glad that I did cramp.","person":"HEATHER WATSON"},{"question":"You've had some quite tough draws.","answer":"Yeah.","person":"HEATHER WATSON"},{"question":"When you get what is a fairly decent draw, did you feel quite a lot of pressure that you needed to capitalize?","answer":"I definitely expected myself to win today. I've had some tough draws in the past, and I knew it was a big opportunity today. I didn't want to waste it. But at the same time I didn't want to get frustrated with myself if some things weren't going so well because that just wouldn't help me out there on the court. But, yeah, I definitely think I put that extra bit of pressure on myself.","person":"HEATHER WATSON"},{"question":"Do you know Pervak, have you had much to do with her?","answer":"Last time I played her was Australian Open juniors in the quarterfinals. I lost. She won that year. But, yeah, I've seen her around. Lefty. Tough player. She makes a lot of balls.","person":"HEATHER WATSON"},{"question":"Was the crowd very helpful today?","answer":"Oh, yeah, the crowd were awesome. I didn't expect there to be so many people for the first round on like a backcourt, but it was unbelievable.","person":"HEATHER WATSON"},{"question":"One of the best atmospheres you've played in?","answer":"Uhm, yeah, I think playing Centre Court Wimbledon was a great atmosphere, too (smiling). But, yeah, it was good today.","person":"HEATHER WATSON"},{"question":"The problem you had last week, the elbow problem, was that a one‑off or what?","answer":"That was the same thing I had two years ago at Wimbledon against Motilide Johansson in the first round when my elbow went. When it happened in my singles match in Auckland, I knew what it was. It felt exactly the same. So I took everything off my serve there. I think that did help in the recovery 'cause it wasn't as bad as it was at Wimbledon.","person":"HEATHER WATSON"},{"question":"And what have the doctor or trainer said to you about the elbow long‑term? Do you think it's going to be a problem?","answer":"They said there could be like scar tissue inside, and that's what's made it come back. I just have to keep my shoulder and all the muscles around my arm loose and start doing stuff to look after that. After matches, I look after my legs a lot, but I never really look after my arms, think about what my arms go through. I'm starting to do that a lot more now.","person":"HEATHER WATSON"},{"question":"Are you serving at full power?","answer":"Not today. At the beginning I was probably serving like at 50. I wasn't even getting it on the strings at the beginning. But by the end I'd say I was serving about 80, 70, 80.","person":"HEATHER WATSON"},{"question":"It's a new year. I know you take stock in the off‑season. Is there anything going forward that you're going to try to do differently this year to achieve your goals?","answer":"Yeah, the way I go about things, I just want to be more professional, like what I'm eating, things in my diet, making sure I get enough sleep, doing the right things before and after a match. Just small things, but they make a big difference.","person":"HEATHER WATSON"},{"question":"Are you going to have to cut out any sort of nice things that you're particularly fond of?","answer":"Yeah, it's really tough actually. Three days ago I had one of these Oreo cakes in the cafeteria. Oh, it was so good. But I'm not going to have another one.","person":"HEATHER WATSON"},{"question":"All year?","answer":"No, no, no, no. Well, next month I'll allow myself (smiling).","person":"HEATHER WATSON"},{"question":"Was that your mum I saw?","answer":"No.","person":"HEATHER WATSON"},{"question":"She's not here?","answer":"No, she's not here.","person":"HEATHER WATSON"},{"question":"Do you think the conditions here actually do suit the way you want to play and the way you'd like to play?","answer":"Yeah, I think they do. I think the court really suits my game. I love the courts here. I really feel confident on them, like I play well. Today I think I just went about it wrong, my match tactics. I tried to, you know, be consistent with a girl that's just going to be there all day. When I can hit the ball like I did later on, I should have been doing that in the first place.","person":"HEATHER WATSON"},{"question":"Was it a surprise to you after that break how much the match completely changed?","answer":"It felt really good. It wasn't a surprise to me because I knew I could do it. But I just didn't know if I was going to change it around 'cause it was just taking way too long. Uhm, but that break did help. And I was able to refocus.","person":"HEATHER WATSON"},{"question":"Were you worried at that point, before you called the trainer?","answer":"Yeah, I was worried. I wasn't playing well at all. Like I said, I thought it was a great opportunity, you know, I'm not drawn against a top‑five player in the world. I really wanted to take advantage of this. I had a great finish to last year. This is the first slam. I was really looking forward to it, very motivated. When I got out there, I mean, the first set just went, I lost 6‑2, and then, you know, I thought I could turn it round in the second set. Didn't have a great start. I was a little worried. I thought I was just wasting an opportunity.","person":"HEATHER WATSON"},{"question":"Does it help to finish your mindset since you won that title?","answer":"I feel a lot more confident. I believe in myself. Like this match today, I felt I should have won, and if I didn't I would have been extremely disappointed. Yeah, and I think it just really gives you confidence, and I'm using it to push myself more in my training, make sure I'm working hard every day and not having a slack day.","person":"HEATHER WATSON"},{"question":"Do you think you can beat anyone?","answer":"Yeah, I do.","person":"HEATHER WATSON"}]}
