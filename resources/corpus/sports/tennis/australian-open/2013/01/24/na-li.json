LI/M. Sharapova\r\n      6‑2, 6‑2\r\n    \r\n    THE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. \r\n    \r\n    Q.  Is that as perfect of a match as you could have hoped for?\r\n    NA LI:  Yeah, always hopefully.  But after I was play after 20 years, first time in my life, you know. \r\n    Beginning of the match I was nervous.  I was happy I come back to semis again, but for some reason I really want to win the match. \r\n    I don't know what happened today.  Just come to the court, feeling like, Okay, just do it.  Yeah. \r\n    \r\n    Q.  Does it feel different to be in the Australian Open final this time compared to the first time?\r\n    NA LI:  I mean, 2011, first time to the Grand Slam final, I was a little bit shocked because I didn't know what I should do.  Also no one tell me what I should do on the court.\r\n    But this time I got more experience, so I think should be better. \r\n    \r\n    Q.  As far as your playing goes, are you better prepared?\r\n    NA LI:  You mean tomorrow? \r\n    \r\n    Q.  For the final than you were with your game plan and everything. \r\n    NA LI:  At least now I'm sitting indoor.  They're still playing on the court. \r\n    Doesn't matter.  I mean, final is final.  Only one player can win the match.  So everyone for sure is fighting on the court.  And also is tough match because is maybe so many thinking on the court, so... \r\n    \r\n    Q.  Do you think your buildup and having so many matches under your belt held you in good stead against Maria today and also for the final?\r\n    NA LI:  I don't know.  I mean, everyone doing the schedule last August something.  So everyone is different.  You couldn't prepare everyone doing the same. \r\n    \r\n    Q.  How important is the work you have done with Carlos Rodriguez to get to the final?\r\n    NA LI:  Until now is good; beginning was a little bit tough.  But I think until now, I mean, at least we are trust a lot for both. \r\n    And, yeah, I don't know.  He's doing good job. \r\n    \r\n    Q.  Do you think having Carlos on your side this time will make it easier than 2011 in the final? \r\n    NA LI:  What? \r\n    \r\n    Q.  Do you think it will be easier this time in the final now that you have Carlos with you to give you advice and help you prepare? \r\n    NA LI:  I mean, if I'm not in the final, he always help me, so... \r\n    I mean, I think next time I should bring Carlos come with me.  I know so many media interested about him, so maybe next time we can do it together (smiling). \r\n    \r\n    Q.  You had lots of tight games and you managed to stay focused and keep emotions in check.  Is that something you worked on?\r\n    NA LI:  Yeah, I was working very hard in winter training with Carlos.  This is the plan, what we should, do for all the year, yeah. \r\n    \r\n    Q.  What goes through your mind? \r\n    NA LI:  Yeah, maybe like before I was like already too sure opponent.  I was angry or something. \r\n    Start this year, I try to cool down on the court.  Yeah.  Like Hollywood, you know.  You don't have to show opponent what are you thinking.  A little bit like Hollywood, but not real. \r\n    \r\n    Q.  And that's work?\r\n    NA LI:  Until now not bad.  Yeah, I have to still continue to work, yeah. \r\n    \r\n    Q.  Yesterday Jo‑Wilfried Tsonga was asked why top‑seeded women's players lose more than the top‑seeded men.  He said because of hormones, because women are more emotionally unstable. \r\n    NA LI:  And then? \r\n    \r\n    Q.  Do you have any thoughts on that? \r\n    NA LI:  I mean, but for all of the world, why should the man marry for the women?  It's, how you say, different thinking.  Women's tour is women's tour; men's tour is totally different.  So nothing prepare for that.\r\n    \r\n    Q.  You don't think hormones have anything to do with it; you think it's more about tennis?\r\n    NA LI:  Sorry about that.  Now I'm only interesting about tennis.  Maybe when I retire I'm thinking about the hormones one day. \r\n    \r\n    Q.  Do you have a theory on why there's sort of upsets at the top level in the women's game as opposed to the men? \r\n    NA LI:  I mean, if I'm retire, I will go to university to learn this thing and I can answer you. \r\n    Sorry about that. \r\n    \r\n    Q.  You have a big following in China.  Do you feel the expectations of people back home to win these Grand Slam matches?  Do you still feel pressure?\r\n    NA LI:  No.  I think right now is much, much better than two years ago, because two years ago is first one to final, first one to win.  For the people, so exciting. \r\n    I think now have one time.  I think the second time they think, Oh, she win again.  She in the final again.  Maybe not so interesting anymore.  I don't know, maybe. \r\n    \r\n    Q.  Is that also an internal change for you that you're putting less pressure on yourself and you just have the confidence to go out and play well because you have before? \r\n    NA LI:  Yeah.  I mean, right now, I mean, what I should worry about?  I was working so hard in winter training.  I think now is everything just back to me.  So I come to the court, take the racquet, enjoy the tennis, yeah. \r\n    \r\n    Q.  Jiang Shan's English name is Dennis.  Do you have an English name?\r\n    NA LI:  No.  I think my name is so short I even didn't need English name. \r\n    \r\n    Q.  Do you have any thoughts about your next opponent who you fight face, Victoria or Sloane?\r\n    NA LI:  I saw Victoria win first set already.  So I don't know, because my coach is still watching.  So he should give me some information tomorrow, and we prepare for final. \r\n    \r\n    Q.  What did you learn after losing the final here?\r\n    NA LI:  I really hungry about title, yeah.  It's really ‑ how you say ‑ first time I was feeling I really near or close to the title. \r\n    So, yeah, I think this time should be, I don't know, maybe different story or maybe same story.  But I will try. \r\n    \r\n    Q.  Sloane Stephens has been eating dinner at the same restaurant every night.  Have you been going to the same place?\r\n    NA LI:  No, I always try different.  No, because, I mean, I didn't want to do always the same.  I like to try different food to enjoy the life. \r\n    But we always do the same things.  If I play next day, and tonight all the team will have together for dinner.\r\n    \r\n    Q.  Has Carlos shown you a couple new places in Melbourne you haven't been to before?\r\n    NA LI:  I always take them to Chinese food.  Doesn't matter they want or didn't want.  I say, Tonight we go Chinese restaurant.  They say, Okay.  First two times, they was so exciting.  After third time, they say, Okay. \r\n    I didn't ‑ how you say ‑ if I have a choice, I would never choose the western food.  So maybe they know.  They just say, Okay.  Still after dinner they have to say, Thank you. \r\n    I was so exciting.  Okay, you're welcome, you're welcome.  They was like, Oh, my God. \r\n    \r\n    FastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n                \n          ","interview":[{"question":"Is that as perfect of a match as you could have hoped for?","answer":"Yeah, always hopefully.
