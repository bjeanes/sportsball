# Sports Text

Scraped from the incredibly thorough [ASAPsports](http://www.asapsports.com/).

I couldn't find any indication of license on that site and all the text was available
without a pay wall. I'm not sure about the legitimacy of storing the text here
but I need it in some sort of useful format and they
[don't have an API or archive](https://twitter.com/asapsports/status/417834626401333248).

Clearly, all copyright belongs to them and this is merely a cache for analysis.

I will remove if it becomes problematic and leave the script to fetch them from the
source instead.
