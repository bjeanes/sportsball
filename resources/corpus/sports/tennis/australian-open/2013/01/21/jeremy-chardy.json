\r\n    JEREMY CHARDY:  Yeah, it's more difficult because it's tough to win three sets in a row against big player.  They have a chance to come back all the time, to change the game. \r\n    I don't want to think too much about this match.  I want to enjoy this one first.  Tomorrow I have one day.  No doubles, no singles, so it's good.  I will be focused on my match against him or Simon tomorrow night. \r\n    \r\n    Q.  Your first quarterfinal in a Grand Slam.  How does it feel?
