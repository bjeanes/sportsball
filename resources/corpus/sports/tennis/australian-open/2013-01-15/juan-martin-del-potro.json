I made very good start for this Open.","person":"JUAN DEL POTRO"},{"question":"Do you look at your half of the draw? You're with Federer and Murray. What do you think about...","answer":"No, they are so far from me at the moment. I just looking in my second round, and will be tough match here. We play fifth sets and matches can be tough for all the players, so I just thinking about my second round. Hopefully I can go far, but I need to play better and better.","person":"JUAN DEL POTRO"},{"question":"You're the only other guy in the draw who has won a Grand Slam besides those three in the last however many years. Obviously there are probably people looking at you as a possible going through to the final. Do you think that for yourself?","answer":"Yeah, of course. I'm here trying to do that, but it's not easy. The last 33 Grand Slams win the same names, the same players. But I know how tough is win a Grand Slam. But I know the way to win a Grand Slam, also. So I'm trying to do that for this year.

If Rafa could be here would be a favorite for sure also. But Roger, Novak, Andy Murray, and other guys can be the favorites to win the tournament.","person":"JUAN DEL POTRO"}]}
