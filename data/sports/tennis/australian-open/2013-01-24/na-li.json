Yeah.","person":"NA LI"},{"question":"Does it feel different to be in the Australian Open final this time compared to the first time?","answer":"I mean, 2011, first time to the Grand Slam final, I was a little bit shocked because I didn't know what I should do.

They're still playing on the court. Doesn't matter. I mean, final is final. Only one player can win the match. So everyone for sure is fighting on the court. And also is tough match because is maybe so many thinking on the court, so...","person":"NA LI"},{"question":"Do you think your buildup and having so many matches under your belt held you in good stead against Maria today and also for the final?","answer":"I don't know.

Yeah, I have to still continue to work, yeah.","person":"NA LI"},{"question":"Yesterday Jo‑Wilfried Tsonga was asked why top‑seeded women's players lose more than the top‑seeded men.
