{"sport":"Tennis","event":"AUSTRALIAN OPEN ","date":"2013-01-22","people":["Nicolas Almagro"],"interview":[{"question":"The leg obviously is giving you a fair bit of grief. What's wrong with it?","answer":"I don't know what's wrong. I think I played a really good match today. Was close. I think was a great battle. Well, at the end was really tough because I just start to feel some things in 4‑3 on the third set on my ankle and on my adductor. Well, after that was really tough and he start to play better and better and he is the winner.","person":"NICOLAS ALMAGRO"},{"question":"So you tore something rather than cramped?","answer":"Cramping?","person":"NICOLAS ALMAGRO"},{"question":"You tore the adductor?","answer":"I don't know really, but I need to check with my doctor right now after the press conference. But I think‑‑ I don't feel a really good feeling.","person":"NICOLAS ALMAGRO"},{"question":"Take us back to the three opportunities to serve for the match. How frustrating was that to have that chance and not get it done?","answer":"Well, I think was tough because I couldn't serve really good because I was serving with all my body, with full power. After that, 4‑3 in the third, I start to miss a lot of first serve. I think when you play second serve with David, was really tough to beat him. Well, I don't want to think about that because it's just 10 minutes I finish the match. Maybe I have time to think tomorrow or later. Not now.","person":"NICOLAS ALMAGRO"},{"question":"The career record now against Ferrer, is that really starting to bother you?","answer":"I don't want to think about that. He is the No.4 of the world. He is the favorite. He beat me many times, but many matches were close.","person":"NICOLAS ALMAGRO"},{"question":"Was this the closest today?","answer":"I don't know if it was or not. But I remember in Cincinnati few years ago I was set up and 6‑5 returning for the match, and I had three or four match point. But today was a big opportunity for me. Well, I gonna work to be ready for the next.","person":"NICOLAS ALMAGRO"},{"question":"You said you did the injury in the first set. Was it hard to get out of your head in the second and third sets?","answer":"When you don't feel really good you start to think many things, but...","person":"NICOLAS ALMAGRO"},{"question":"Did you suffer a separate injury in the tiebreak?","answer":"Well, I don't know if it's that moment, the most important moment of the match or not. I feel pain during all the end of the third set and fourth set. There was many, many chance. After that he return every point and was really tough to win a point. I'm disappointing with the tiebreak, but I need to work more to be ready to play with the top players.","person":"NICOLAS ALMAGRO"},{"question":"Until 5‑4 in the third set, your average speed on the first serve was 200 kilometer per hour. You were basically perfect with the service, forehand, backhand. What happened mentally next?","answer":"If you not 100% to play, I don't know if it's mentally or not. I think I tried to play my best tennis today. I say few days ago with my last press conference I will try to play aggressive, I will try to play my best tennis, and I think I did today. Is not enough to beat David. But we'll see what happen in the future. I am ready to work and we'll see. I don't know. I don't want think that it's a mentality problem. If I have mentality problem, I think I didn't win the first two sets.","person":"NICOLAS ALMAGRO"}]}
