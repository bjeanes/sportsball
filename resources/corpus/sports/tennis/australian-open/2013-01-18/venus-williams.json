But, you know, there's always other days to play better.","person":"VENUS WILLIAMS"},{"question":"Do these results motivate you to get back to where you were or is it a kick in of the guts because you're trying hard?","answer":"Honestly, every day that I practice is a day that I'm motivated to be better. Regardless of my results I want to be better, the best, the best that I can bring.","person":"VENUS WILLIAMS"},{"question":"Obviously not your A game. She was making it hard. At the end of the second set did you feel like you might be getting in there and start to turn things around?","answer":"Yeah, definitely. You know, one or two holds makes a big difference between 3‑All or having a break. So it's always important to take those opportunities.","person":"VENUS WILLIAMS"},{"question":"Was there anything in particular in your game that you thought was dissatisfying?","answer":"I just had a lot of errors. You know, that never helps.","person":"VENUS WILLIAMS"},{"question":"What is your schedule like from here to Miami?","answer":"Well, I'm playing doubles tomorrow, so that's definitely my focus right now.

But, yeah, at this point I just feel like, you know, I'll focus on the doubles and then get ready for the next tournament. I mean, I have to wait till French Open to play another major in singles, but there will be a lot of tennis in between.","person":"VENUS WILLIAMS"},{"question":"On a non‑tennis note, did you watch any of Oprah's interview with Lance Armstrong?","answer":"No, I didn't.","person":"VENUS WILLIAMS"},{"question":"Is it something that players are talking about, his confession to doping?","answer":"I think everyone is pretty much focused on the tennis. Maybe other players are talking about it. I have no idea.","person":"VENUS WILLIAMS"},{"question":"Do you have any reaction?","answer":"I can't talk about anything I don't know anything about, so I'm just going to keep my mouth shut. I'm not an expert on that stuff. That's all I can say.","person":"VENUS WILLIAMS"}]}
