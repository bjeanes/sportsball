{"sport":"Tennis","event":"AUSTRALIAN OPEN ","date":"2013-01-22","people":["Tomas Berdych"],"interview":[{"question":"It seemed like the second set was obviously a lot better for you than the other three. What do you think made the difference in that one?","answer":"Well, I mean, we don't play for one set. One set was not enough. Well, I mean, the only thing I can say that I played him many matches. Actually, yeah, I seen him play, you know, way better. He's play really good today. But the matches before he play much, much better. It was quite kind of a chance for me, but I didn't come up with my best game and that's what was deciding today.","person":"TOMAS BERDYCH"},{"question":"Is your back bothering you again?","answer":"No. I mean, it's just daily problems that basically every tennis player has.","person":"TOMAS BERDYCH"},{"question":"After last year, you no doubt were prepared for Novak to be in pretty decent physical shape, but were you surprised how well he physically bounced back from that very long match that he had less than two days ago?","answer":"No. I just said if Stan would be the one who win, you know, then we can see‑‑ I would say for Stan we would probably see it would affect him. But definitely not for Novak. I mean, he's probably the fittest guy on tour right now. As I said, you know, I seen him play really much better. But it's not nothing that I'm saying something against him. I mean, it's just all the credit that he was able to get from that. He just show how fit he is, yeah.","person":"TOMAS BERDYCH"},{"question":"All players say he's the fittest. But how different is that from the beginning of his career?","answer":"What? Every single player is improving. That's what he's doing. I'm trying to do the same. That's how it is.","person":"TOMAS BERDYCH"},{"question":"Did he not allow you to play your game?","answer":"Well, I mean, I was really, especially in the beginning, quite not hitting the clean balls, you know. That's very big problem because the ball doesn't have a speed, it's not long enough, then it was quite easy for him. That was basically the problem. I was not able to, you know, be aggressive enough. That's it. So, yeah, probably.","person":"TOMAS BERDYCH"},{"question":"Stepanek said if you want to beat Novak Djokovic at a Grand Slam, you need to play special. Do you think you played an extra special game tonight?","answer":"Me?","person":"TOMAS BERDYCH"},{"question":"Yes.","answer":"I didn't beat him.","person":"TOMAS BERDYCH"},{"question":"Was it 100% or 110%?","answer":"It was like 75 maybe. If it would be more, then we're answering your question. If you bring something extra, then you have a chance to beat him. What was the score?","person":"TOMAS BERDYCH"},{"question":"In four sets.","answer":"And who won?","person":"TOMAS BERDYCH"},{"question":"Djokovic.","answer":"So there's the answer. I mean, I cannot say anything else. You just ask and answer yourself, so that's how it is. What do you want me to say on that?","person":"TOMAS BERDYCH"},{"question":"What is your schedule before Indian Wells?","answer":"Where is that? It's quite far.","person":"TOMAS BERDYCH"},{"question":"It's March.","answer":"So I play Davis Cup, then I have other tournaments, Montpellier, Marseille, Dubai. There's still lots to play.","person":"TOMAS BERDYCH"},{"question":"Are you still going to play as much Davis Cup?","answer":"I'm playing the first round and that's all what it is so far. Let's see what's going to be in the future. But I go one by one.","person":"TOMAS BERDYCH"},{"question":"Is Novak going to win this, in your opinion?","answer":"Well, I mean, I think, yeah, he's going to really appreciate those two days when he's going to get now to get rest and get really the comfort what he needs, and then he's going to be very strong again. It could happen anything. Even to play David, it's very tough one. It's the semifinal, so you cannot find easy opponents at all. It's hard to say. It's hard to guess. On the other side, there are another great players as well. Basically I'm not good in guessing the winner, so let's see.","person":"TOMAS BERDYCH"},{"question":"You would probably make more money if you did betting.","answer":"We'll stay with the tennis.","person":"TOMAS BERDYCH"},{"question":"Davis Cup was a huge success for the Czech Republic. Do you think playing against Switzerland, away match, without Roger Federer, will that be a bit of an advantage for you or not?","answer":"Of course. It's a big difference to playing Swiss team without Roger. We don't even have to talk about him. It's really big help even that we play outside. But the other hand, me and Radek are fit, going to be in the team again. That's the strongest what we have. We will try to make the first round because it's always really tough after be that successful, it's very close time in between winning and then playing the first round. That's our goal, to try to not to play down, try to win in Switzerland.","person":"TOMAS BERDYCH"}]}
