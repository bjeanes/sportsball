{"sport":"Tennis","event":"AUSTRALIAN OPEN ","date":"2013-01-23","people":["Serena Williams"],"interview":[{"question":"Your emotions, where are you at at the moment?","answer":"I'm here in the press conference. I don't know. I haven't really thought about it too much.","person":"SERENA WILLIAMS"},{"question":"How is the physical injury? How is the back?","answer":"It's fine. You know, just nothing. I think everyone at this stage in the locker room has something wrong with them, so it's fine. There's no excuse there.","person":"SERENA WILLIAMS"},{"question":"You were serving at about 130 kilometer an hour after the back problem. What exactly happened? Was it tight?","answer":"Well, a few days ago it just got really tight and I had no rotation on it. I went for this dropshot in the second set and it just locked up on me, so... I think that it just‑‑ I couldn't really rotate after that, which I guess is normal. I don't know.","person":"SERENA WILLIAMS"},{"question":"That point where it happened, can you talk us through that moment.","answer":"Well, I was running to the net for a dropshot. As I went to hit it, it was on the backhand. I even screamed on the court. I was like, Ahh. I totally locked up after that. It was just like‑‑ it was a little painful. But, I mean, it's okay. It was what it was.","person":"SERENA WILLIAMS"},{"question":"When you went off court, what sort of treatment did you have? Did you take any antiinflammatories?","answer":"Well, there's only so much you can do for that. Not too much you can do. Just tried to have it loosened up a little bit. I'm always on antiinflams for my ankle, so you can't do too much more.","person":"SERENA WILLIAMS"},{"question":"Did it feel better when you came back on? Were you freer?","answer":"No. It was still tough. It's hard to rotate to the backhand. It was giving me trouble. But it was fine. I think my opponent played well and was able to do a really good job.","person":"SERENA WILLIAMS"},{"question":"The microphones on court picked up you saying this has been the worst two weeks. What did you mean by that?","answer":"I've had a tough two weeks between the ankle, which is like this big every day, and my back, which started hurting. A lot of stuff, so... It was what it was.","person":"SERENA WILLIAMS"},{"question":"Is it the worst couple weeks you've had at a Grand Slam?","answer":"For a Grand Slam, absolutely. Absolutely. Oh, my gosh, I'm almost relieved that it's over because there's only so much I felt I could do. I was unaware the microphones picked that up. But, oh my gosh, it's been a little difficult. I've been thrown a lot of balls these two weeks.","person":"SERENA WILLIAMS"},{"question":"Did you ever think about retiring at any point?","answer":"Doug, are you kidding me? I'm not retiring. Oh, you mean, retiring in the match (laughter). Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you meant my career. Like, you're crazy. Uhm, I mean, I thought about it like for a nanosecond. I mean, it's a quarterfinal of a Grand Slam. Even if I have to take off in a wheeler before I retire.","person":"SERENA WILLIAMS"},{"question":"Did you get the sense Sloane was freaking out a bit towards the end of the second set, just the drama of it all, the injury and everything else, and it was quite hard for her to push through?","answer":"Yeah, I definitely felt like she got a little nervous, which is natural. You know, it's her first quarterfinal. She had a chance to tie it at one set all. So I definitely feel like she was, uhm, a little nervous at that point.","person":"SERENA WILLIAMS"},{"question":"Could you tell us what you think of her as a player and how far she's going to push on from here.","answer":"She's a good player. She runs fast and she gets a lot of balls back. That's always a plus to have in your career.","person":"SERENA WILLIAMS"},{"question":"What did you think of the quality of the match before you tweaked the back?","answer":"I don't think my level was high. I don't know how many unforced errors I ended up hitting, but for sure more in one set than I probably did in the whole tournament. So I think her level was high. But as for my end, I mean, you can tell. You each can say this is definitely not my best match in months.","person":"SERENA WILLIAMS"},{"question":"Obviously your serve speed went way down when you had the injury. You started to work your way back in the match in the third set. How much of that were you fighting yourself and how much were you fighting injury in that third set?","answer":"Well, at that point you just have to pretend like nothing's wrong. You think of worst‑case scenarios. You know, I just thought, Okay, just pretend nothing's wrong and just try your best. That's what I tried to do. Even tried to hit my serves harder. My legs were fine, so running was fine. Just rotating was a little tough.","person":"SERENA WILLIAMS"},{"question":"Yesterday in the game you also hurt a little bit. I want to know before the game today, what did you think about it? Have you ever worried about your injuries?","answer":"About what?","person":"SERENA WILLIAMS"},{"question":"Just think about it, think about the injury and worry about that.","answer":"No. I've actually been injury‑free for a while until I got to this tournament, and just fell and had the ankle issues. I think that kind of started everything up the chain because I'm compensating and maybe it made my back hurt. I don't think about the injuries during the match so much. I just try to keep going and honestly do the best that I can. And really it's all I can do for that day.","person":"SERENA WILLIAMS"},{"question":"Did you get some frustrations out with that racquet smash?","answer":"Oh, yeah. Did you see it? I even had a wry smile on my lips after that. It made me happy, unfortunately.","person":"SERENA WILLIAMS"},{"question":"You were in Mauritius for some preparation. That is my home town. How did it go there?","answer":"It went well. I loved it. I hope I can go back.","person":"SERENA WILLIAMS"},{"question":"You mentioned being relieved, this being a difficult two weeks. It's been a long time since you've lost a match. Does the pressure build up? Does it become more and more difficult to keep it going?","answer":"No, I feel no pressure. The buildup of losing a match? I personally don't like to lose, so the less I lose the better for me. And if that means I have a lot of pressure, that's fine. It doesn't bother me.","person":"SERENA WILLIAMS"},{"question":"Do you think she's quiet in the game?","answer":"You think she's quiet?","person":"SERENA WILLIAMS"},{"question":"In last several games you said, You should grunt. She's a little bit quiet. Also as a mentor for her ‑ she thinks of you as a mentor ‑ in the future, will you give her some advice?","answer":"Well, honestly I've never really given her advice, so... But she doesn't grunt. Some people grunt; others don't. So it is what it is.","person":"SERENA WILLIAMS"},{"question":"You were such a favorite for the tournament. How do you see it now on the women's side? Who do you see progressing to Saturday?","answer":"Well, I think it's interesting. I think Sloane, she's in the semis now. That gives anyone a chance. I think Victoria's playing well. She's a fan favorite and she's defending champ. She handles the pressure really well. So we'll see.","person":"SERENA WILLIAMS"},{"question":"Is that No.1 ranking of big importance to you? If it's going elsewhere now, does that add to the disappointment or not really?","answer":"No, I didn't think about that so much. For me, I'm trying for Grand Slams and to win titles, you know, get to 50 titles. Not Grand Slams. No.1 is awesome if I get it. Like I said, I think I'll get there one day. If not, I've had it, so it is what it is. But for me it's definitely more about doing well in tournaments.","person":"SERENA WILLIAMS"}]}
