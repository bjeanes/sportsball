12, 2013\n\t\t  \n\t\t  Serena Williams\n\t\t  MELBOURNE, VICTORIA\n\t\t  THE MODERATOR:  Questions for Serena, please. \r\n\r\nQ.  Are you in the best condition of your life and playing the best tennis of your life or do you think you've played better elsewhere?\r\nSERENA WILLIAMS:  I can't answer that.  I get asked that all the time.  But I feel like I'm just in the moment right now.  For this moment, I'm playing well.  I really hope I can keep it up and continue to play well. \r\n\r\nQ.  Can't gauge it against other periods?\r\nSERENA WILLIAMS:  I can't right now.  I can go look at film and try to gauge it, but I don't really want to do that, so... \r\n\r\nQ.  You said you've been watching your old matches on YouTube.  Any particular ones you look back on?\r\nSERENA WILLIAMS:  I always want to watch singles and I end up watching a lot of doubles matches because they're really fun to watch. \r\nA few Wimbledon matches I've been watching, some stuff, so... \r\n\r\nQ.  What do you want to get out of tennis?  You've done pretty much everything in the game. \r\nSERENA WILLIAMS:  Well, for me, my goal is just to do the best I can.  Like I love playing.  I want to be out there on center court hopefully doing the best I can. \r\nI set my goals per tournament, go with it from there.\r\n\r\nQ.  Would that be winning every slam this year?\r\nSERENA WILLIAMS:  That's an incredible goal.  It hasn't been done since the '80s.  I don't know if I can do it.  Maybe someone else can.  We'll see. \r\nBut it's tough to say. \r\n\r\nQ.  What do you feel like inside when you're playing out of your mind like you have been in the last little while?\r\nSERENA WILLIAMS:  I feel really calm actually.  I feel really calm and really relaxed.  I feel really good.  I don't feel like I'm panicking.  I don't feel like I'm doing anything over the top.  I think for me that's a key. \r\n\r\nQ.  Do you ever worry that it's going to stop?\r\nSERENA WILLIAMS:  No.  I don't think about it's going to stop, am I going to do this, that.  No, I kind of live in the moment and go with that. \r\n\r\nQ.  What do you think of Sam Stosur's chances?  What is she like as a competitor and do you think the Aussie crowd will lift her?\r\nSERENA WILLIAMS:  She has so much behind her here with the Aussie crowd.  She's a great player.  She's in really stellar form. \r\nI think she's a really good competitor.  I don't think there's someone that you would say I really want to play against this person because she does everything really well on the court.  So, yeah. \r\n\r\nQ.  You entered the mixed doubles here last year with Andy Roddick and didn't get to play.  One of the few Grand Slam titles you are missing.  Are you planning on doing that again this year?\r\nSERENA WILLIAMS:  Yeah, we'll see.  I'm playing doubles this year.  I don't think I'm up to playing three events.  I love hanging out at the tennis, but probably not that much.  So I'm just going to stick to the singles and doubles this year. \r\nI did have a partner, but my doubles partner wanted to play with me.  Can't say no to my doubles partner.\r\n\r\nQ.  How do you see that with you and Venus this year?\r\nSERENA WILLIAMS:  We love playing doubles.  We'll definitely probably play most of the slams.  I don't know.  We play it by ear.  We just like to go out there and have fun and play. \r\nWe don't have really big goals, now that I think about it.  We just have fun.\r\n\r\nQ.  Venus was one of the first things that used to get discussed if you were on the opposite side of the draws.  Is that something you look at, where she is in relation to you?\r\nSERENA WILLIAMS:  That's always what I look for.  I never look at the draw, but that's always what I look for. \r\n\r\nQ.  How confident are you in Venus's form?\r\nSERENA WILLIAMS:  I feel like she's playing great.  For me she's my least favorite opponent on the tour.  That's not because she's my sister, but because she's playing a lot like me.  It's not so fun to play that. \r\n\r\nQ.  Do you like being such a favorite for tournaments?\r\nSERENA WILLIAMS:  You know, I've been a favorite so many times and I've been the ultimate underdog several times.  I like being the underdog a little bit.  You don't have any pressure.  Being the favorite is fun, too, because then you feel like you're the one to beat. \r\nIf it came down to it, I would prefer to be the underdog. \r\n\r\nQ.  Is it the way you see it, though, that you are that much a hot favorite for this?\r\nSERENA WILLIAMS:  I don't think like that.  I feel like I have to win seven matches.  Everyone in this draw has to win seven matches.  They have the same opportunity to do it as I do. \r\nIf I can do that, then that would be great.  I think that's going to be the person that can win. \r\n\r\nQ.  People have been comparing you lately to Andre in terms of coming into your best tennis a little later on in life, feeling an appreciation for it because of things you've been through.  Is that fair?  Do you agree with that? \r\nSERENA WILLIAMS:  Yeah, you know, I love Andre.  He's a great guy.  I think our careers have some similarities, maybe just a little bit.  I was playing fabulous a decade ago, as well, as he was in his career. \r\nUhm, it's not a bad person to be compared to.  He's someone that definitely is historic and a great American tennis player.
