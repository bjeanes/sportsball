{"sport":"Tennis","event":"AUSTRALIAN OPEN ","date":"2013-01-13","people":["Bernard Tomic"],"interview":[{"question":"How did you celebrate last night?","answer":"Woke up at 6 a.m. It was a great night. It was difficult for me to sleep. But I managed to get to bed. It was an amazing night.","person":"BERNARD TOMIC"},{"question":"Sunk in you got your first title now?","answer":"It has. It's a wonderful feeling. Hopefully there's many more to come. For me to win my first title in Australia is huge. I couldn't ask for anything better.","person":"BERNARD TOMIC"},{"question":"How do you put that to the back of your mind going into Tuesday?","answer":"It's amazing. It's a lot of confidence. It's very important for tennis to have a lot of confidence, so I'm really confident. I'm going to use this as much as I can for Tuesday and this whole tournament.","person":"BERNARD TOMIC"},{"question":"Is this the most confident you felt, having won eight straight matches now?","answer":"Yeah, for sure. I'm playing really good tennis, feeling physically really well. That's why I think I've been playing good out there.","person":"BERNARD TOMIC"},{"question":"The crowd in Sydney, then arriving in Melbourne today, do you feel like you're swaying public perception?","answer":"Yeah, a bit. It's all hit me now quickly. It's a bit strange. But I've got this tournament to focus on now. I've got to do as best as I can here, not disappoint myself, keep going as much as I can, prove to myself that I'm ready to play here in Melbourne as well.","person":"BERNARD TOMIC"},{"question":"Do you try to sort of rest up a little bit today and tomorrow to freshen yourself?","answer":"Yeah, I had today off. I did some stuff. Didn't spend any time on court. So tomorrow I'll hit a few more balls, get ready obviously for Tuesday to play. Hopefully I can have a good game. I haven't played my opponent or hit with him. It's going to be a difficult match. I hope I can win.","person":"BERNARD TOMIC"},{"question":"You made a great impression here last year. What do you think in your game has improved in the 12 months since?","answer":"I think dramatically over the last few months a lot. This is where I'm going to use all this I learnt over the last year, especially the last few months, what I practiced on, to this tournament. This is our first Grand Slam. This is where you want to do the best. I want to do as best as I can for this tournament, so I'm going to be ready on Tuesday. I'm going to keep going and try to win as many matches as I can. Obviously I'm really confident. I haven't lost a match yet. It's a good opportunity to use something like that and I'm going to use it.","person":"BERNARD TOMIC"},{"question":"You engaged with the crowd a lot last night. Is that something you'll use this week?","answer":"Yeah, absolutely. It's such a great privilege playing in Australia. The fans support you. This is where I play my best tennis. I'm going to use it here, and hopefully the crowd can get behind me a lot and support me throughout my matches. That's when I'll play better and better.","person":"BERNARD TOMIC"},{"question":"You mentioned you haven't played your next opponent before. Your game is fairly unpredictable. Do you think that helps you?","answer":"Yeah, I think it's good I haven't played him or hit with him. It can be a difficult match. It's not easy playing the first round of a Grand Slam. Everyone is ready to go for the first slam, so you don't know what to expect. I've got to come out there and play the tennis I've been playing the last few weeks, then I give myself the best chance to win.","person":"BERNARD TOMIC"},{"question":"You showed some good stamina the last couple weeks. Any difficulties going five sets that you see?","answer":"I mean, best‑of‑five is always difficult. You don't know how your body can pull up. I think I'm pretty fit. Not a lot of problems. I played five straight matches in Sydney. I had no problem after the tournament, so I feel physically fine. I'll be ready for five sets any day of the week.","person":"BERNARD TOMIC"},{"question":"I'm sure you'll probably say 'take it one match at a time'. Third round against Roger Federer, can you beat him?","answer":"Well, I saw the papers this morning (laughter). Well, if he gets that far. I mean, like I said, the first round is my goal, to beat this guy. I do struggle against some guys out there. I don't know how this guy can play. If the possibility comes for me to win that first match, I'll look for my next round, which is also tough. I would love to get in that position to play Roger in the third round. He has to get there as well. You don't know what can happen. Tennis is a funny sport. So we'll see.","person":"BERNARD TOMIC"},{"question":"(Question regarding James Magnussen.)","answer":"I would love him to come down. He's got to go to Perth for the swim title. It's a shame.","person":"BERNARD TOMIC"},{"question":"Is he your new BFF?","answer":"I don't know about that. He's a good mate. Met him in the Olympics. Spent a bit of time in the Gold Coast with him. A month back he came up. I got to know him. I'm just happy he supported me in Sydney.","person":"BERNARD TOMIC"},{"question":"What has your dad's message been to you? Has he been pretty thrilled with what you've been doing?","answer":"Yeah, you know, it's huge to put myself in that position to win a title and mention my father. We did do a lot of hard work together. Growing up, he was the main thing, the main person that was always behind me, as well as my parents. For me to win my title, have my dad by my side, was amazing. It was a huge feeling. He is for me the best coach. That's why I've always had him by my side and always will continue to have him there to support me. Hopefully I can win many more tournaments.","person":"BERNARD TOMIC"},{"question":"How would you just reflect on 2012? It was a year of considerable ups and downs maybe. How would you sum up your 2012?","answer":"Well, what could I say?","person":"BERNARD TOMIC"},{"question":"Something printable.","answer":"Where should I start (laughter)? I learnt so much. Ups and downs. I had my ups at the start in January. But then I had my downs. I'll learn from my downs. Lucky I learnt at my age, 20, not 25 and 28. I'm learning now. This is something really good. You can use this in your career. I'm happy I learnt everything and I can use it to get the best potential out of myself.","person":"BERNARD TOMIC"}]}
