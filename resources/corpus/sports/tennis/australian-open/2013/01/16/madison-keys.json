{"sport":"Tennis","event":"Australian Open","date":"2013-01-16","people":[{"name":"Madison Keys","gender":"unknown"}],"text":"\n          \n            \n\t\t  AUSTRALIAN OPEN\n\t\t  \n\t\t  January 16, 2013\n\t\t  \n\t\t  Madison Keys\n\t\t  MELBOURNE, VICTORIA\n\t\t  M. KEYS/T. Paszek\r\n  6‑2, 6‑1\r\n\r\nTHE MODERATOR:  Questions, please. \r\n\r\nQ.  Not unexpected given how well you've been playing.  She's a seeded player.  You have to be pretty pleased. \r\nMADISON KEYS:  Yeah, very happy.  You know, thought I played pretty well; happy with how the day went.\r\n\r\nQ.  What was the key for you today? \r\nMADISON KEYS:  I think serving.  My serving definitely helped me today.  You know, in the first set when I got down Love‑40 when I was up 4‑2, I think being able to hold and come back definitely helped me out. \r\n\r\nQ.  Do you feel different in this slam versus the other ones you've played in the past?\r\nMADISON KEYS:  I feel more prepared for this one.  My first US Open main draw, it was a big stadium and wasn't really used to it.  But I feel good about this one so far, yeah. \r\n\r\nQ.  What are the differences in terms of when you're on the court and how that manifests itself? \r\nMADISON KEYS:  I think it's kind of in everything.  You know, worked really hard this off‑season.  Think I'm in pretty good shape.  Working with a new coach.  It's been going really well.  Hopefully I can keep it up. \r\n\r\nQ.  I don't know if you saw Lindsay Davenport tweeted today that she hadn't had hope for a young American like you since Serena Williams.  How does that make you feel to get that kind of compliment?\r\nMADISON KEYS:  I mean, it makes me happy.  You know, I think I've been working really hard.  I think it's starting to show. \r\n\r\nQ.  No nerves at all.  Have you felt any real nerves going on court? \r\nMADISON KEYS:  First round here was a little bit nerve‑wracking.  But I think today it was much better just having that one match under my belt.  You know, I was playing an Australian, big court, crowd was against me, but I felt like today I just played tennis.\r\n\r\nQ.  When you were 14, you had that win in Ponte Vedra, and then you were at the French Open, the wild card, and you had a stomach muscle pull.  How long did that take you out?  Took a while to heal, didn't it?\r\nMADISON KEYS:  I don't really remember, honestly. \r\n\r\nQ.  You have Kerber next round, a top‑five player.  A little bit different approach or just go out and try to rip it?\r\nMADISON KEYS:  I mean, I think just really have to focus on playing my game and just worrying about me.  She's obviously a good player.  She's been around and she's done well the last couple years. \r\nI think if I just focus on what I'm doing, then it doesn't really matter. \r\n\r\nQ.  So both your parents are lawyers, right?\r\nMADISON KEYS:  Yes.\r\n\r\nQ.  Both still working?\r\nMADISON KEYS:  Both are still working, yes.\r\n\r\nQ.  How did you get from lawyers' kid, especially two working lawyers, to become a tennis player at this level?\r\nMADISON KEYS:  Complete luck.  No one in my family plays tennis.  I just came upon it one day.  Just thought, Hey, I'll try it.  You know, it's worked out pretty well.\r\n\r\nQ.  So you got addicted pretty quickly?\r\nMADISON KEYS:  For sure.  Right away.\r\n\r\nQ.  First time?\r\nMADISON KEYS:  First time, fell in love. \r\n\r\nQ.  Went home and said, I got to play tennis every day; get me lessons? \r\nMADISON KEYS:  Every single day.  My parents fed me balls.  Eventually it turned into having a coach, and then it went to being at an academy.\r\n\r\nQ.  Your parents don't play?\r\nMADISON KEYS:  Neither one can play tennis.\r\n\r\nQ.  What initially attracted you when you saw tennis for the first time?\r\nMADISON KEYS:  The outfits (smiling). \r\nReally wanted a tennis dress.  My parents told me that if I played, they would buy me one.  I was like, Hey, I'll try it. \r\n\r\nQ.  Who were your tennis idols growing up?  Who did you like to watch?\r\nMADISON KEYS:  Really, really liked watching Kim Clijsters.  I thought she was very passionate, and I thought her movement was incredible.\r\n\r\nQ.  How old were you when you started, picked up the racquet for the first time?\r\nMADISON KEYS:  I was four. \r\n\r\nQ.  How much of the transition, adjustment, I mean, you switched from Chris to the USTA, but it's on the same property.  Was there a big adjustment or... \r\nMADISON KEYS:  I mean, there wasn't a huge adjustment.  I mean, it's the same place, same courts, just different coach.  Working with someone different. \r\n\r\nQ.  Do your parents watch you play?  Are they watching on TV now?\r\nMADISON KEYS:  Yes, they are.  My mom is in Illinois right now working.  My dad is in Florida with my little sisters.\r\n\r\nQ.  They're watching you online?\r\nMADISON KEYS:  Yes, they both watched me.\r\n\r\nQ.  Do they get nervous?\r\nMADISON KEYS:  My mom doesn't really get nervous.  And I don't think my dad gets very nervous either. \r\n\r\nQ.  Any chance they're going to come over if you advance a little bit further?\r\nMADISON KEYS:  Probably not.  I think I'm here by myself. \r\nBut I always tell them that they have to come like maybe next year. \r\n\r\nFastScripts Transcript by ASAP Sports\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            \n          ","interview":[{"question":"Not unexpected given how well you've been playing.
