As they say, what's good for the goose is good for the gander. Kia Motors and the Australian Open has a lot of benefits from this great sponsorship. For example, since 2009, Kia Motors brand exposure has grown by more than 50%, and media value was grown by more than 100%. Also in terms of sales around the world, we have grown in between 2002, when we started this sponsorship, and last year 2012, 2002 we sold globally only 950,000 cars. Last year we sold 2.7 million cars, exactly 184 times versus 10 years ago. Particularly in China last year, we sold more than half a million cars. So in that I think this great sponsorship has improved our image and also increased our awareness among the customers very much. I view it this way.","person":"THOMAS OH"},{"question":"Mr. Laver, how do you feel to have a Chinese face return to the final in your house after two years?","answer":"I'm thrilled to be a part of the Kia announcement to further the success the Australian Open has had here for the past 10, 15 years. It just keeps getting larger and larger. When you see 70,000 people here last week at a day session, it's just marvelous to see the successes that the Australian championships have had. I think when you see the publicity that's going with Kia and then when you look at the development around here, we just went across to the new facilities with the 10 or 15 courts that have gone in, and it's going to help the young players. I think in the next four or five years we're going to be able to find some brilliant young kids out of this area. I think this is just another rung on the ladder that says Australia is going to get in the mix in the world to come. THE MODERATOR: We have a terrific day here with the men's semifinal tonight and the women's doubles final shortly on court. We thank you for joining us today for the Kia Motorsâ€‘Australian Open renewal signing ceremony. Hope you enjoy the last couple days of the Australian Open 2013, brought to you by Kia Motors.","person":"ROD LAVER"}]}
