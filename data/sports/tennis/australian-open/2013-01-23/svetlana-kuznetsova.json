{"sport":"Tennis","event":"AUSTRALIAN OPEN ","date":"2013-01-23","people":["Svetlana Kuznetsova"],"interview":[{"question":"What do you think was the key to the first set? Was there a specific point?","answer":"Well, today was a match, you know, I had to play with a top player, one of the best players at the moment. These matches, you got to play very consistent. This is what for the moment kills me after my break, is my consistency. And I didn't serve well. So this was two key points, I think, during the match what I didn't do well. That's why I lost the match.","person":"SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA"},{"question":"You're doing a lot of sliding around out there, a lot of running. How does the knee feel?","answer":"Yeah, actually it was very good except first game of the second set. I was really scared because I almost broke it again the same way I did it. They say on the replay it look like my ankle, but my knee went backward, the same way, exactly. Was like millimeters, very close, so I break it again the same way I did. So I was really scared that moment. I was a little bit freaking out because I didn't want to have another time off.","person":"SVETLANA KUZNETSOVA"},{"question":"But it felt fine after?","answer":"So far it's all right because the time I broke it was straightaway I could not walk.
